## Week 1 Practice Visual Literacy Skills
### Prompt
Yin Hong, Hundreds of Birds Admiring the Peacocks, Ming dynasty, late 15th century.
Hanging scroll, ink and color on silk, 7'10 1/2" x 6'5". Cleveland Museum of Art

When writing about art, one of the ways we offer evidence is through description of the artwork as a primary source. This week we learned about the language of formal or visual analysis, the formal elements, composition, subject matter and principles of design. To practice your visual literacy skills, please write a description of Hundreds of Birds Admiring the Peacocks in 500 words.  Take a look at descriptions from your peers. This is a great way to get exposure to a variety of observations.  To help your observations consider the following:

* What is the subject matter? (who or what is depicted)
* Describe three examples of pattern and variation in the image.
* The image is a mix of monochromatic (variations of one color) and color. How does the artists use of this combination create emphasis?

In this bird-and-flower painting, Yin Hong, the Chinese artist who lived in the late 15th century during the Ming Dynasty, illustrates a scene of many different kinds of birds and flowers in a natural setting. The work is rendered on a 7'10 1/2" x 6'5" silk scroll. The artist wisely utilized black ink to render the background objects to provide a heavy theme but brilliantly used bright color to highlight the birds and flowers in this wonderful Chinese painting. 

Black ink is used to provide a solid theme for this elegant work. The background of the work shows brown color, as also observed in most other Chinese ink paintings on silk, due to the use of natural ochre pigments. The artist uses black ink to illustrate a willow tree growing from the ground on the right edge of the work. The heavy trunk of the willow tree leaned toward the left and occupied one third of the background. On the top, its thin branches extend horizontal toward the left. Its slender and flexible branches with narrow leaves hung down over the water on the left portion of the painting, presumably a pound. Water waves were rendered on the left of the painting. The artist used smaller gaps between waves on the upper side to create a sense of three dimensional space, with the waves closer to the viewer having bigger gaps. The trunk has many knots and cavities. The artist rendered the willow truck overlapping in front of several white cherry blossom branches extending from the right. A few leaves were rendered on the branches with several white cherry blossom flowers crisply bringing the sense of spring to the viewers. In the background, the lower portion of three tree trunks with knots and cavities vaguely showing in the center top in the work, without their upper portion and leaves visible to the viewers, creating a sense of mystique in the distance. A big Taihu stone is rendered in the lower portion of the painting. Taihu Stones are often seen in Chinese gardens. Rich people in ancient China usually purchased them as decoration in their garden for their mystical shape. They are famous in China and are limestone with many holes. The ground, Taihu stone, the tree trunk, the waves are all painted with only black ink. This monochromatic style is often observed in many other Chinese paintings. 

Color objects in this artworks grab the viewer’s attention! The artist rendered flowers and birds with vivid bright colors. In the lower portion, we see the green leaves and several big flowers. From the left to the right: a purple camellia, a white chrysanthemum, and a pink chrysanthemum. The viewer can also peek through the hole of the Taihu stone to see a small purple camellia bulb hiding. On the right vertically from the top: A golden chrysanthemum, a white paeonia lactiflora half showing behind the stone, a big red paeonia lactiflora, a smaller pink paeonia lactiflora, and a smaller white magnolia. The artist uses the color of these flowers to grab viewers attention. There are also many birds in the painting. The biggest two are a pair of peacocks. The smaller female one, without an elaborated tail, is closest to the viewer on the lower part of the work, extending its neck eating a small flower. A larger male peacock, rendered in the center of the work, exhibiting his beautiful tail on top of the Taihu Stone, between the white and golden chrysanthemum. A pair of pheasants, one brown, one black and white, stood behind the big willow tree trunk. Both pheasants have red features around their eyesockets. There are many different types of small birds depicted in the painting, some are in black and white, while others are in yellow, green, blue, or red. Some of them are flying, while others are standing on top of the ground or tree branches. The rendering of these animals and vegetation produce a harmonic and peaceful view, reminding us about heaven.

Vivid patterns are showing in several places in this painting. The most obvious one is the eyespot pattern on the peacock tail, and the pattern on the rest of their feathers. On the left, the pattern of curve lines illustrate the water waves. The pendulous willow branches on the top and details of the chrysanthemum petals also form elegant organic patterns. The textures of the willow barks and the surface of the Taihu stone is depicted with monochromatic patterns. 

This late 15 century Chinese painting in a sense is similar to many still life paintings produced in the Netherlands a couple hundred years later. Both focused on the rendering of natural life and documented different kinds of biological species in nature for us to peek into the natural world several hundreds years ago.
### Feedback  10/10
Lovely. You find a nice balance between describing the overall artwork while including specific details of the formal elements. Wonderful incorporation of the language of visual analysis paired with close observation. I love how you address the monochromatic elements as well as the color. You are such a strong writer!
