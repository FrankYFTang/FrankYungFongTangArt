# PHTG7 Exploring Visual Expression
I took PHTG7 Exploring Visual Expression in De Anza College during Fall 2024 (September 23 - December 9-13, 2024). This repo archived my work for this course. My professor is Sita Bhattacharji.

## Assignment 1 Color, Pattern, Curve and Shadow

### Instruction: 
Go out into the world and find subjects that exemplify these categories. Experiment! Change your vantage point or your angle of view; come in close; look at things or people or places that you might not otherwise consider "image-worthy"! Shoot lots of images! You can sort them afterwards. Think about the images in terms of these categories. For example: all color images have color in them (that's pretty obvious, right?), but that doesn't mean that the image is "about" color, or that it exemplifies color. You will also find that some, or perhaps many (!), of your images can be placed in more than one category: think about which category it best exemplifies. Check out the example images--almost all of which were shot by previous students!
  * Color 
  * Pattern 
  * Curve 
  * Shadow

* Classmate Feedback: 
  * **Philip Ossenbruggen:** Your pattern shadow and curve look good although the color picture could be brighter. I noticed that all of your pictures could fit under the pattern section.
  * **Sett Htoo:** You bring art to daily things that are ordinary. As if you slowed down time to appreciate a moment. These are awesome.
* **Teacher Feedback:** You have done an excellent job on all of these images, Frank. You have played around with distance, angle of view and perspective very nicely. My favorite is the "TurtleBuddyAndI", however!

## Assignment 2 Depth of Field
### Instruction: 
Depth of Field is the area or amount of space in the image that is in focus. Specifically, it is the amount of space in front of and behind the point of focus that is in focus. By adjusting certain mechanisms or situations you can change the depth of field, or the amount of space that is in focus.

The primary way that photographers change the depth of field in an image is by changing the size of the aperture. The smaller the aperture (the larger the f/stop number), the greater the depth of field will be. That is, the more will be in focus. The larger the aperture (the smaller the f/stop number) the shallower the depth of field will be. That is, the less will be in focus.

The second way of changing depth of field is to change the focal length of the lens. When you zoom the lens you increase the focal length of the lens. The longer the focal length of the lens, the shallower the depth of field will be. The shorter or wore wide angle the lens, the greater the depth of field will be.

The third way of changing the depth of field is to change the distance from the subject, or point of focus. The closer the subject is to the camera, the shallower the depth of field will be. The farther the subject is from the camera, the greater the depth of field will be.

Note: Changing the depth of may change the composition of the image: if you change the focal length of the lens, or change the distance from the subject, you change the amount of information that is recorded. Think about the composition that you have in mind, and the effect(s) these things may have on the image you are making.

The Assignment:  Read This Before You Begin the Assignment!!!

Find or construct three different settings with space and physical elements going back in the frame. This means that you can either look around for a space that naturally meets this requirement, or you can arrange subjects and objects so that they meet this requirement. (See examples in the "Depth of Field" Module.)

For each situation, you will make one set of two images, one showing shallow depth of field, one showing great depth of field. This means you are to make three sets of two images: a total of six images. Use one of the three things that affect depth of field for each set, i.e. for the first set change the aperture, and keep the point of focus, the focal length of the lens and the distance from subject unchanged. For the second set change the focal length of the lens, and keep the aperture and the distance from subject unchanged. For the third set change the distance from subject, and keep the aperture and the focal length of the lens unchanged. In each set keep the point of focus the same, i.e. focus on the same spot.

Use the extremes for each factor: f/2 and f/22; the widest angle and the most telephoto settings of your lens; move in very close to the point of focus, then back way up.

Do not use flash.
Do not use the “Auto” or “Program” modes.

For Submission:

* Create a new folder entitled with your name, first and last, and “Assignment #2”.
* Within that folder create three new folders, one for each set of images.
* Entitle them with their respective subjects, i.e. “Aperture”, "Focal Length of Lens", "Distance from Subject"
* Within each of these folders you will place the corresponding images.
* Entitle each image descriptively in terms of the settings you used, etc. (see example above).
* “ZIP” (compress) your folder and submit the "ZIP" file to Canvas.

* Classmate Feedback: 
  * **Albert Gomez:** Hi Yungfong, Nice photos. I think you fulfilled the requirements of the assignment fine. I like the selection of the dog and the pine cone. Nice and clear photos.
  * **Sett Htoo:** Hello! I absolutely love the images under Aperature. They both have such a homey feeling to them as the warm colors complement each other so well. The images under Distance from Subject are also so beautiful. I love how the pinecone complements the fall-ish background as the image has mainly brown tones in it. The images under Focal Length of Lens are so beautiful! The dog is adorable and I love how the white color of the dog contrasts the background and just brightens up the whole image. Overall, I really loved all your images. I think you're set to be a really great photographer :D
  * **Dylan Le:** Great Job, I am amazed by how the photos look. I love how warming each of the photos look and how there's a consistent theme between each photos. I also like how you were able to get all these photos on campus. Great job
* **Teacher Feedback:** What an incredibly cute dog...! Great job and great images, Yungfong! You have shown the changes in depth of field very nicely in each of these sets of images.

## Assignment 3 Written Assignment
### Instruction: 

Option 1: Visit an art museum or gallery, a list of which follows, and select two images to discuss. These images can be by the same photographer, or by two different photographers.

For each photographer or image, you are to write a relatively short--about 2 paragraphs--statement. This means that the entire statement should be 4 paragraphs: about 1 page.

Who is the artist and what type of work/photography do they do? You may need to do some basic research online to get this information. If you do, do not forget to cite your source(s)!

Describe and discuss each image. Give the title, date and medium, and a description of it in terms of the composition. Discuss each image: why did you chose these particular images? What drew you to them? Perhaps you did not like this piece of work: why did you not? Be specific!

 
Option 2: From the list of "Videos" in the Modules, select two photographers and watch one video for each photographer.

As with the above, write a relatively short--about 2 paragraphs--statement for each photographer/video. This means that the entire statement should be 4 paragraphs: about 1 page.

This should include the title of the video you watched, who the artist is and what type of work/photography they do. You may need to do some basic research online to get this information. If you do, do not forget to cite your source(s)! You should then talk about why you chose to discuss this particular photographer. Did his or her appeal to you? Did it not? Why--or why not? Be specific and use examples.

* **Teacher Feedback:** Though I would like you to have discussed 1 or 2 specific images of Titarenko's, you have done a great job, Yungfong. I am glad that you enjoyed the work of Alexey Titarenko and Arnold Newman. These are very good discussions and I get the feeling that you really looked at and thought about the work of these two fairly different photographers.

## Assignment 4 Motion
### Instruction: 
Make two images of the same moving subject: one showing (a blur of) motion, the second stopping or freezing the motion.
Make two images: one showing the motion of a moving subject, the second stopping or freezing the motion of a moving object. This set need not be of the same subject.
Make two images of two different subjects, using panning to show/stop motion.
 

For the first set of images you will photograph the same moving subject twice: in the first you will use a slow shutter speed to show a blur of motion, and in the second you will use a fast shutter speed to stop or freeze the motion. (Remember to use equivalent exposures to ensure that the images are correctly exposed.)
For the second set of images you will do the same thing(s) as above, but you do not have to use the same subject in each image.
In the third set of images you will not be stopping motion. By panning--following the moving subject with your camera as you release the shutter--you will be showing motion by having the background appear in motion instead of the subject. This is another way of showing motion. Use a relatively slow shutter speed for panning: try 1/25-1/30.
 

Use the “Manual” or the “Shutter Priority” (or TV) mode
Do not use the "Auto" mode
Do not use your flash!

* Classmate Feedback: 
  * **Natalie Nguyen:**  Hi Yungfong, your photos amazed me because of how clear the quality of your camera is! I thought your pictures were great and matched the instructions of the assignment perfectly. Great job! 
  * **Nathan Wong:** Hey Yungfong, I really like the picture of the fountain as that is an object that I would not expect to be depicted as an object in motion. I like your creativity when it comes to photography. good job overall!
* **Teacher Feedback:**  
  * Set 1: Excellent! I love the dreamy, almost surreal affect of the water in motion...
  * Set 2: Lovely images. You could have used a faster shutter speed--perhaps 1/250 or 1/500 to really freeze the motion of the water, but you have done a good job on these.
  * Set 3: Great job, Frank! Both images show the Panning effect beautifully. I particularly like how the "Redshopper's" feet are moving faster than her body.

## Assignment 5 Favorite Things, etc.

* Classmate Feedback: 
  * **Kimia Kooshkbaghi:** Hi Yung, great job on sharing your thoughts and the pictures! I really like how you included a picture of yourself as your favorite person—it’s a wonderful way to show self-love and confidence. I also enjoyed seeing the place. As for the college building, I understand why it disturbs you—it’s really sad that it is being ruined. I also had the same feeling.
* **Teacher Feedback:**  
You have done an excellent job, Frank. All of the "Favorites" work well, but I think that the last "Yosemite" image is the most "evocative". Why did you chose to show yourself from that vantage point--from below? Just curious! The "portrait" of Buddy would, I think, be more effective 1) a bit lighter and 2) with shallower depth of field so that the background information does not compete with the subject. I can see why you chose to show the Flint Center as your "Disturbing" image(s). I have not been on campus for a couple of months, and was...startled by its appearance. Both "Inspiring" images are both lovely and, as was the Yosemite image, "evocative".

## Assignment 6  "In the Manner of...": Famous Photographer Project: 4 images
* Submission [Images](https://photos.app.goo.gl/suH71dPFGNWjTKbh7) [Paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FnatqEzz3OHhX1aRbbqdDCoZ4V3pqjOEcPkyHXIE16Y)
* * Classmate Feedback: 
  * **Arsalan Najm:** Hi Yungfong! Your explanation is clear and well-written, and it’s evident that your images closely reflect Duane Michals' multiple exposure techniques. The technical details, like the long exposure in "Buddy30sec" and the ghosting effect in "SelfDouble," show a strong understanding of Michals' style. Your thoughtful use of reflections and the challenge of adjusting focal lengths also align well with his approach to creating layered, surreal images. Overall, your work captures the essence of Michals' style while demonstrating your own creative interpretation.👏👏👏
  * **Jazmin Manchester:** Hello Frank,The images you submitted are amazing!! I love your multiple exposure images especially "SelfTriple0.3sec", the way the photo has been took and it being landscape gives a lot of character to your photo! I like how each photo is in black and white too so they're themed the same and none of them are out of place.
Amazing work!! Thank you for sharing your images!
