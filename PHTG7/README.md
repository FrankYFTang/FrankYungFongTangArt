# PHTG7 Exploring Visual Expression
I took PHTG7 Exploring Visual Expression in De Anza College during Fall 2024 (September 23 - December 9-13, 2024). This repo archived my work for this course. My professor is Sita Bhattacharji.

## Assignment 1 Color, Pattern, Curve and Shadow

* [Submission](https://photos.app.goo.gl/PVbeu51MFG3hgpom7)
* Classmate Feedback: 
  * **Philip Ossenbruggen:** Your pattern shadow and curve look good although the color picture could be brighter. I noticed that all of your pictures could fit under the pattern section.
  * **Sett Htoo:** You bring art to daily things that are ordinary. As if you slowed down time to appreciate a moment. These are awesome.
* **Teacher Feedback:** You have done an excellent job on all of these images, Frank. You have played around with distance, angle of view and perspective very nicely. My favorite is the "TurtleBuddyAndI", however!

## Assignment 2 Depth of Field
* [Submission](https://photos.app.goo.gl/NQsnAn6pym9ZaNSx6)
* Classmate Feedback: 
  * **Albert Gomez:** Hi Yungfong, Nice photos. I think you fulfilled the requirements of the assignment fine. I like the selection of the dog and the pine cone. Nice and clear photos.
  * **Sett Htoo:** Hello! I absolutely love the images under Aperature. They both have such a homey feeling to them as the warm colors complement each other so well. The images under Distance from Subject are also so beautiful. I love how the pinecone complements the fall-ish background as the image has mainly brown tones in it. The images under Focal Length of Lens are so beautiful! The dog is adorable and I love how the white color of the dog contrasts the background and just brightens up the whole image. Overall, I really loved all your images. I think you're set to be a really great photographer :D
  * **Dylan Le:** Great Job, I am amazed by how the photos look. I love how warming each of the photos look and how there's a consistent theme between each photos. I also like how you were able to get all these photos on campus. Great job
* **Teacher Feedback:** What an incredibly cute dog...! Great job and great images, Yungfong! You have shown the changes in depth of field very nicely in each of these sets of images.

## Assignment 3 Written Assignment
* [Submission](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15ewUYkJv4vz5YHkP16hDYYcSX2mOZ8A0Wxr0zV_FRjY)
* **Teacher Feedback:** Though I would like you to have discussed 1 or 2 specific images of Titarenko's, you have done a great job, Yungfong. I am glad that you enjoyed the work of Alexey Titarenko and Arnold Newman. These are very good discussions and I get the feeling that you really looked at and thought about the work of these two fairly different photographers.

## Assignment 4 Motion
* [Submission](https://photos.app.goo.gl/a97YTETvybkF2ezS7)
* Classmate Feedback: 
  * **Natalie Nguyen:**  Hi Yungfong, your photos amazed me because of how clear the quality of your camera is! I thought your pictures were great and matched the instructions of the assignment perfectly. Great job! 
  * **Nathan Wong:** Hey Yungfong, I really like the picture of the fountain as that is an object that I would not expect to be depicted as an object in motion. I like your creativity when it comes to photography. good job overall!
* **Teacher Feedback:**  
  * Set 1: Excellent! I love the dreamy, almost surreal affect of the water in motion...
  * Set 2: Lovely images. You could have used a faster shutter speed--perhaps 1/250 or 1/500 to really freeze the motion of the water, but you have done a good job on these.
  * Set 3: Great job, Frank! Both images show the Panning effect beautifully. I particularly like how the "Redshopper's" feet are moving faster than her body.

## Assignment 5 Favorite Things, etc.

* Classmate Feedback: 
  * **Kimia Kooshkbaghi:** Hi Yung, great job on sharing your thoughts and the pictures! I really like how you included a picture of yourself as your favorite person‚Äîit‚Äôs a wonderful way to show self-love and confidence. I also enjoyed seeing the place. As for the college building, I understand why it disturbs you‚Äîit‚Äôs really sad that it is being ruined. I also had the same feeling.
* **Teacher Feedback:**  
You have done an excellent job, Frank. All of the "Favorites" work well, but I think that the last "Yosemite" image is the most "evocative". Why did you chose to show yourself from that vantage point--from below? Just curious! The "portrait" of Buddy would, I think, be more effective 1) a bit lighter and 2) with shallower depth of field so that the background information does not compete with the subject. I can see why you chose to show the Flint Center as your "Disturbing" image(s). I have not been on campus for a couple of months, and was...startled by its appearance. Both "Inspiring" images are both lovely and, as was the Yosemite image, "evocative".

## Assignment 6  "In the Manner of...": Famous Photographer Project: 4 images
* Submission [Images](https://photos.app.goo.gl/suH71dPFGNWjTKbh7) [Paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FnatqEzz3OHhX1aRbbqdDCoZ4V3pqjOEcPkyHXIE16Y)
* * Classmate Feedback: 
  * **Arsalan Najm:** Hi Yungfong! Your explanation is clear and well-written, and it‚Äôs evident that your images closely reflect Duane Michals' multiple exposure techniques. The technical details, like the long exposure in "Buddy30sec" and the ghosting effect in "SelfDouble," show a strong understanding of Michals' style. Your thoughtful use of reflections and the challenge of adjusting focal lengths also align well with his approach to creating layered, surreal images. Overall, your work captures the essence of Michals' style while demonstrating your own creative interpretation.üëèüëèüëè
  * **Jazmin Manchester:** Hello Frank,The images you submitted are amazing!! I love your multiple exposure images especially "SelfTriple0.3sec", the way the photo has been took and it being landscape gives a lot of character to your photo! I like how each photo is in black and white too so they're themed the same and none of them are out of place.
Amazing work!! Thank you for sharing your images!
