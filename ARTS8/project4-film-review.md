**Title:** Week 10 Viewing Films Response- The Golden Age of Film Animation, 1928-1957

The five videos show us the history of animation, and some early technology advancement of animation in the 20th century, the reason to advocate for the climate crisis, and three styles of animation done by Lotte Reiniger, Leonard Charles Huia Lye, and Norman McLaren.

From the first video, we learn that the animation starts with some drawing without a meaningful story, then adding some personality to the character. Music and violence are the key part of the success of Mickey Mouse. The Great Depression increased the demand for viewing animation. Color, advancement of sound effect, dedicated music team, character development, the use of rotoscoping, multi-depths camera and moviola greatly improve the production quality of Snow White. Claymation in 1960 shifted the animation into a different 3 dimensional space of look. In the 1970's, a lot of advertisements used animation and opened a new market for animators. In the mid 1980â€™s, Lucas Film started to develop Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) and it was later acquired by Steve Jobs to form Pixel. Pixel produced Toy Story by using CGI in 1995. In the meantime, Japanese animation, anime started to influence worldwide viewers. In the second video, we learn it is important to address the climate crisis. The third film shows us the process of silhouette animation by Reiniger, who creates animation by placing cut papers in movement. The forth film, Tusalava, shows Lye use primitive shapes, mostly geometric shapes in the background and circles with different size and border width in movement to construct different complex abstract objects, or even lifeforms. In the later part of the film he also uses lines, rectangles, The fifth film shows McLaren use fast moving simple shapes to create the sensation of upbeat emotion. Lye and McLaren both highly utilize music or sound effects that synchronize with visual elements to enhance their work.

For my project, I decided to emphasize the fact that most media outlets only connect the climate crisis with the fossil fuel consumption from vehicles and point out some other areas which have a big impact but got ignored.  I will follow the aesthetic inspiration of Reiniger because her style is easier to render detailed scenes.
