**Title:** Week 3 Viewing Films Response- Constructivism

The Project Two films not only introduced Constructivism but also briefly mentioned other art movements such as Da Da, Futurism, Cubism, and Suprematism. The core philosophy of Constructivism, their usage of figure as well as text in their design, and their usage of geometric shape helped me not only to design the topic text of my work but also stimulated my aesthetic design choices.

During my preliminary sketching phase of Project Two I have three different ideas, two of them are quoting statements from famous artists Ai Weiwei and Wassily Kandinsky. But then I realized the core of Constructivism should be a call to action so the artwork is not only beautiful but also useful. This motivated me to decide to use the theme “ART Speak”, an imperative sentence, for my project. Notice this phrase is not “Art speaks”, as a statement, with a third person present tense verb with suffix ‘s’ at the end of the word “speak”, describing what the “art” is currently performing, but rather a call toward the art asking it to “speak”. Constructivists also used graphics to accompany text for communication. I want the design to connect to the Civil Rights movement since racism and police brutality toward black communities is still a current critical issue in our society. Therefore, Rodchenko’s usage of Brik’s figure in his work inspired me to put Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. speaking image, during his “I have a dream” speech, on the top left portion to represent the kind of “speak” calling the “art” to act. Since geometric shapes were often designed into Constructivism arts, I frame the text within a rectangle to model a plate and two long rectangle lines as its stand. On top of the word “Speak”, I added a mouth shape logo to emphasize this action.

I still feel hard to fully understand some concepts mentioned in the films, in particular about Futurism and Suprematism, since they are not the main topics of the film but just briefly mentioned and I would like to study more about those concepts. I found it interesting to learn that many posters were created by Constructivists to spread their political ideas but I wonder how we could measure the effectiveness of this form of communication. I believe the combination of typography with graphic is the key motif of Project Two and I will refine my design to the final sketch based on that core value.
