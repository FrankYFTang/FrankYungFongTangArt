# ARTS 8 Two-Dimensional Design
I am taking ARTS 8 Two-Dimensional Design in De Anza College during Winter 2023 (Jan 9 - March 31, 2023). This repo archived my work for this course. My professor is Eugene Rodriguez.

## Self Introduction Video
### Instruction from the professor:
Here are the four prompts I would like you to respond to:
- Your name, major and school you plan to transfer to, if not sure, say "not sure but maybe...."
- Why is being an artist important to you?
- Do you prefer online, in-person or hybrid (combination) art classes? Why?
- Imagine you have your first perfect job in the arts -- what is your first self-authored project?

## Project One - HOUSES IN MOTION
### Instruction from the professor:
To begin your creative process I would like you to think about the houses we live in especially during this past pandemic. Some people in this country live in mansions (along with their numerous yachts) while others live on the street or under freeways in structures of cardboard. I am asking you to think about what this means for the richest nation on earth to have people living in the open. A home is more than a house or edifice, is it not?
Now you are ready to begin preliminary sketches. You will be using space, line and form from the elements of design. And from the principles of design you will be using movement, balance and scale.
I would like you to create a house with a door, window and roof. Remember that you are an artist. Think of our moment and all the houses you see from mega-mansions to street tents and all those in-between. What are you saying about possessing a house/home? How do you want your viewer to respond? 
Now I would like you to take your concept of that “house” and construct it (you are actually building it-show the viewer how it comes together) in four frames like that of a film.* Think of this as a story board or graphic novel. You will be moving all your components, in four windows, to build your house in your final frame, the visual pay off. This is a House in Motion.

## Project Two - Information Wars: Words Matter
### Instruction from the professor:
For this project you will be designing the cover for a new art journal. One of the questions I asked you to answer in your Introduce Yourself videos was, “Why is being an artist important to you?” Think about your response and use this as you conceptualize your journal. Also, refer back to the four project objectives above as you create you cover. Art Matters!

Your design must include:
* A name that includes the word “Art”
* You must use two of the fonts created in the 1920s and the 1930s (Refer to the Project Inspiration Page)
* Your journal must address how you see art intersecting with creating a more healthy society. For example, “Art and Critical Thinking” or “Art and Equality” or “Art & Education” or “Art, Education, and Democracy” or “To Make Art is A Human Thing” or “Make Art Not War” or my favorite, "Art Matters!".
* You must also create a logo
For your materials, you will be using one sheet of Bristol board, sized at 14” x 17”, black acrylic paint and black sharpies. Your final painting will have a two-inch Bristol board frame, making your design cover 10” x 13”. Your black paint must be 50% of your painting.

### Project Inspiration: THE 1920s
“To many people the “Roaring Twenties” were all about having as much fun as possible. World War One was over and people wanted to forget about the hardships that it had wrought on society. In Britain—which had incurred debts equivalent to 136 percent of its gross national product—and indeed in the rest of Western Europe, times were not so good and prewar normality was not forthcoming. Unemployment figures were high, women were forced to cede their jobs to soldiers returning from the front, and cuts in public spending were crippling for ordinary working-class people.
Living standards gradually began to improve and it is fair to say that anything would have been better than the hardships and loss of the previous decade. In America things were rather different. A brief economic recession immediately after the war soon passed and the booming U.S. economy launched the age of consumerism. The automobile industry grew rapidly along with other areas of manufacturing; the world’s first skyscrapers in the shape of the Art Deco architecture of the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building were inaugurated; and despite prohibition, the American people were determined to have a good time. Outside of the cities, however, life was not so easy and more than 60 percent of rural America existed in a state of poverty.
In design terms, the manifestos that laid down the rules for the development of graphic style over the next fifty or sixty years were all written and launched during the 1920’s. It was during this decade that Modernism in its many varied forms truly found its feet with Dada, Constructivism, De Stijl, and Art Deco all playing their part, and with institutions like the new Bauhaus leaving an indelible mark on design style which endures to this day. Significantly (at least for those of us that work in the graphics industry), in 1922, William Addison Dwiggins, the American book and type designer, first coined the term “graphic design” in an attempt to collectively describe all his professional activities which included book design, illustration, typography, and so on. It took another twenty years or so for the term to fall into common use as the replacement for the job title, “commercial artist,” but he had at least set the ball rolling. In that sense, whenever the term graphic design has been used in the pages of this book it has sometimes been used anachronistically; a common habit when discussing historical design style and practice.”
