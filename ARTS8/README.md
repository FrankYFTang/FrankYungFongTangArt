# ARTS 8 Two-Dimensional Design
I am taking ARTS 8 Two-Dimensional Design in De Anza College during Winter 2023 (Jan 9 - March 31, 2023). This repo archived my work for this course. My professor is Eugene Rodriguez.

## Self Introduction Video
### Instruction from the professor:
Here are the four prompts I would like you to respond to:
- Your name, major and school you plan to transfer to, if not sure, say "not sure but maybe...."
- Why is being an artist important to you?
- Do you prefer online, in-person or hybrid (combination) art classes? Why?
- Imagine you have your first perfect job in the arts -- what is your first self-authored project?

## Project One - HOUSES IN MOTION
### Instruction from the professor:
To begin your creative process I would like you to think about the houses we live in especially during this past pandemic. Some people in this country live in mansions (along with their numerous yachts) while others live on the street or under freeways in structures of cardboard. I am asking you to think about what this means for the richest nation on earth to have people living in the open. A home is more than a house or edifice, is it not?
Now you are ready to begin preliminary sketches. You will be using space, line and form from the elements of design. And from the principles of design you will be using movement, balance and scale.
I would like you to create a house with a door, window and roof. Remember that you are an artist. Think of our moment and all the houses you see from mega-mansions to street tents and all those in-between. What are you saying about possessing a house/home? How do you want your viewer to respond? 
Now I would like you to take your concept of that “house” and construct it (you are actually building it-show the viewer how it comes together) in four frames like that of a film.* Think of this as a story board or graphic novel. You will be moving all your components, in four windows, to build your house in your final frame, the visual pay off. This is a House in Motion.

## Project Two - Information Wars: Words Matter
### Instruction from the professor:
For this project you will be designing the cover for a new art journal. One of the questions I asked you to answer in your Introduce Yourself videos was, “Why is being an artist important to you?” Think about your response and use this as you conceptualize your journal. Also, refer back to the four project objectives above as you create you cover. Art Matters!

Your design must include:
* A name that includes the word “Art”
* You must use two of the fonts created in the 1920s and the 1930s (Refer to the Project Inspiration Page)
* Your journal must address how you see art intersecting with creating a more healthy society. For example, “Art and Critical Thinking” or “Art and Equality” or “Art & Education” or “Art, Education, and Democracy” or “To Make Art is A Human Thing” or “Make Art Not War” or my favorite, "Art Matters!".
* You must also create a logo
For your materials, you will be using one sheet of Bristol board, sized at 14” x 17”, black acrylic paint and black sharpies. Your final painting will have a two-inch Bristol board frame, making your design cover 10” x 13”. Your black paint must be 50% of your painting.

### Project Inspiration: THE 1920s
“To many people the “Roaring Twenties” were all about having as much fun as possible. World War One was over and people wanted to forget about the hardships that it had wrought on society. In Britain—which had incurred debts equivalent to 136 percent of its gross national product—and indeed in the rest of Western Europe, times were not so good and prewar normality was not forthcoming. Unemployment figures were high, women were forced to cede their jobs to soldiers returning from the front, and cuts in public spending were crippling for ordinary working-class people.
Living standards gradually began to improve and it is fair to say that anything would have been better than the hardships and loss of the previous decade. In America things were rather different. A brief economic recession immediately after the war soon passed and the booming U.S. economy launched the age of consumerism. The automobile industry grew rapidly along with other areas of manufacturing; the world’s first skyscrapers in the shape of the Art Deco architecture of the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building were inaugurated; and despite prohibition, the American people were determined to have a good time. Outside of the cities, however, life was not so easy and more than 60 percent of rural America existed in a state of poverty.
In design terms, the manifestos that laid down the rules for the development of graphic style over the next fifty or sixty years were all written and launched during the 1920’s. It was during this decade that Modernism in its many varied forms truly found its feet with Dada, Constructivism, De Stijl, and Art Deco all playing their part, and with institutions like the new Bauhaus leaving an indelible mark on design style which endures to this day. Significantly (at least for those of us that work in the graphics industry), in 1922, William Addison Dwiggins, the American book and type designer, first coined the term “graphic design” in an attempt to collectively describe all his professional activities which included book design, illustration, typography, and so on. It took another twenty years or so for the term to fall into common use as the replacement for the job title, “commercial artist,” but he had at least set the ball rolling. In that sense, whenever the term graphic design has been used in the pages of this book it has sometimes been used anachronistically; a common habit when discussing historical design style and practice.”

## Project Three - GaGa 4 DaDa
### Instruction from the professor:
1 – First I would like you to watch all three documentaries. Then I would like you write a one-page response. (See required technical specs below) What were one or two things you learned about the art of the early 20thcentury? What are your opinions of Hitler’s denunciation of modern art? And finally, what do think of Dada art?

2 – Next, I would like you to think about the two tenets of Dada art as proposed by Jim Moir’s conversation between he and the artist, Cornelia Parker. One tenet is the political aim of Dada art and the mother is the absurd.

3 – Now you are ready to begin preliminary sketches. Choose one of the two above tenets, the political or the absurd, for this project. I will demonstrate the absurd. You will create an image from two images from a newspaper, magazine or the internet. You will first collage these two images together, then simplify that image and finally paint it. As an option, you can choose a word to go with your idea. My idea will use the word, dumb, using a Dada-inspired aesthetic. I will surprise you with my collaged image in my PowerPoint Presentation.

4 – For your materials, you will be using one sheet of Bristol board, sized at 14” x 17” and black acrylic paint. Your final painting will have a two-inch Bristol board frame. It can be a portrait or landscape format. This makes your image window 10” x 13”.

You will need to paint your composition using the grey scale. You will use a total of nine values of paint starting with pure white and then light grey, medium grey, dark grey and finally pure black. There can be no white background.

## Project Four - The Golden Age of Film Animation, 1928-1957
### Instruction from the professor:

#### Materials: Acrylic paint on Bristol board
#### Objectives: 
1) To use key elements and principles of design in conjunction with the Grey Scale, in order to move the viewer through 2D space,
2) To create a composition that draws conceptual and aesthetic inspiration from Film Animation 1928-1957,
3) To define for yourself the connections between images and cultural values AND in particular how the climate crisis affects the world and the future of society

#### Process:
1 – First I would like you to watch documentaries #1 and #2 as an introduction to the project. Then you will need to watch all three shorts on the three animators to choose your inspiration for the project. They are all very different so take your time to watch them. Next I would like you to write a one-page response. (See required technical specs below) What were one or two things you learned about the animation of the early 20thcentury? Why did you choose the animator you did for the project?

2 – Preliminary sketches. Now that you have chosen one animator for inspiration you will need to decide on a concept concerning the global climate crisis. After watching the video, How To Be A Good Ancestor, what do you want to say about our predicament? Will you propose solutions such as flying cars that don’t use fossil fuels or will you depict a meeting between earthlings and other planetary lives?

3 – You are creating a story board for a one-minute animated film. This is not the actual animation. This is the concept for your film. You would use this in your portfolio to communicate your idea and what happens.

4 – You will have six equal frames to depict your action. The elements of design are important here such as shape (what kinds of shapes) and space (where does the action happen, top to bottom or left to right?). The principles of design are also important, balance, rhythm/movement and emphasis to name a few.

5 – For your materials, you will be using one sheet of Bristol board, sized at 14” x 17” and black and white acrylic paint. Your final painting will have six equal frames measuring 4” in height and 5” in width. I will illustrate this in my PowerPoint Presentation for you to view. You will also write a brief description of the action below each frame. I will also have this illustrated in my PowerPoint Presentation. Neatness matters!

6 – Once again you will use the grey scale to paint your composition. You will use a total of eleven values of paint starting with pure white and then light grey, medium grey, dark grey and finally pure black.

* Tints - three values
* Tones – three values
* Shades – three values
