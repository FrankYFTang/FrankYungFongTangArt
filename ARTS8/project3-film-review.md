The Armory Show 1913 in New York was not well received by American since they were not ready for the advancement in the development of Modern Arts from Europeans. On the other hand, many artists gathered in Germany and flourished. But after WWI Hilter founded Nazi and Nazi started to label modern art as degenerate and try to systematically destroy them. The Dada movement started in Zurich, Switzerland during WWI while artists from different sides of the war gathered in neutral Switzerland to escape the war. They target the languages at first. Some of them later went to Berlin, New York and Paris. In different parts of the world Dada evolved and changed. Some of them challenge the notion of arts via daily objects while others use collage or reconstruction of newspapers. Some see the action of the destruction of art objects as part of the creation of Dada arts. Eventually the movement was gone but some Dada artists flowed into the Surrealist movement. 

Hitlerâ€™s denunciation of modern art is both a personal revenge of being considered as low artistic achievement and out competed by modern art artists as well as a political act to suppress the out of the box thinkers in modern art. It is a horrible act in human history. Hilter is a very talented evil person and demonstrated to us the worst an evil person can do is being very smart and talented. Hitiler understands the power of arts better than many other politicians and therefore he must destroy those artists who had the power to threaten his political power. 

The development and scope of the Dada movement is interesting. I had the chance to visit Zurich Switzerland for a month but unfortunately I was not aware about the history of Dada and therefore never tried to visit those important places. It is very difficult to imagine such an important art movement starting from this place because the atmosphere in Zurich is very unlikely for a new art movement. The city has a traditional look as well as classical sense. The people there feel very conservative and I found it interesting that Dada started there. I see many artworks influenced by Dada and like to learn more about it. The use of collage seems highly related to Dada and it seems the concept of annual Burning Man festival in Nevada also were inspired by Dada. .
