**Title:** Viewing Films Response

The development of the modern day cinema was contributed by people of many different talents: scientists, engineers, physicists, entrepreneurs, magicians, artists, and arguably, even psychologists. 

I learned a lot of facts about filmmaking from these two videos, including the fact that Eadweard Muybridge in 1872 used a multiple camera approach for his study. I believe his approach later inspired Lana Wachowski and Lilly Wachowski to use a very similar approach to film the famous “Neo dodges bullets” scene in their 1999 feature film Matrix. I also learned that in the earlier history of filmmaking the advancement is mostly connected to the collaboration between artists and scientists and engineers, which we observed much less in modern filmmaking. I was not aware that the early invention combined the camera and projector together and the first widespread of films are in documentary style before Thomas Edision until I watched this film. The licensed out kinetoscope viewing business model by Thomas Edison should be viewed as an earlier version of “video on demand” because it allows the viewers to decide the viewing time of the films, instead of watching them on a set schedule. George Melies not only had the creativity to imagine the fantasy, he also had the skill to use double exposure, dissolved mattes, cutting, and other new tools to invent the necessary technology to bring his viewers to this new world he envisioned. Melies also created the cinematography “language” for later filmmakers to follow and moved the focus to narrative filmmaking from the Edison era films. D. W. Griffith’s experiments of using close-up shots, cross-cuttings, and fade-out really shaped the filmmaking today. Sergei Eisenstein’s fragmented and discontinuous montage with his employment of symbolism brought the moviemaking into a new era. 

The earlier development in cinematography seems much more exciting than the development in recent days. We should learn from the spirit of Muybridge, Lumiere brothers, Edison, Melies, Griffith, and Eisenstein to advance the filmmaking more.
