**Title**: Project 1 “Houses in Motion” Self Evaluation

It is fascinating to create two dimensional art in multiple frames to illustrate motion. One point linear perspective creates space but arrows, curls and dots in different scales are more effective to render dynamic flows of objects. 

I realized the key emphasis of this project should focus on the motions of elements rather than the style of the house so I place the first three frames on the upper portion, flowing from left to right, to represent the construction process of the house and use the whole lower portion to paint the house in with vegetation in a natural setting. A thick white arrow flows from left to right, then curves down and points back to the right to direct the visual flow. In the first and second frame, black arrows show the component assembly steps of the building. In the third frame, windy curls are used to create the illusion of windows flying toward the house. It is challenging to create a coherent view, so I render the building in the top three frames by using a one point linear perspective with a single vanishing point, placed slightly above the center of the second frame. The building in the second view is pulling closer to the viewer to invite them to look into the inside. Different scales of dots, inspired by Yayoi Kusama’s infinity room, fill the upper background in the top frames. Windows and vegetation are drawn free hands by sharpies in all three thickness to bring in a sense of randomness in real life. It is hard to fulfill the “50% black paint” requirement and addressed by filling the background of the final frame and the ground in the top three frames with black paint. One technical issue is the black color of the acrylic paint and the sharpies are not exactly the same and are notifiable if examined carefully. I also applied too much paint in some areas and resulted in bumpy dry spots and looked not professional.

Creating motion in two dimensions in multiframe works is fun. Proper use of black background could create a strong foundation of the work. I feel I mastered one point linear perspective in this project. Line drawing, acrylic paint application, and controlling the dot sizes to illustrate the depth in space is harder than I thought. Combining different kinds of arrows and lines could effectively render dynamic flows.
