# EWRT1A HW4
A. The topic for your first essay is peer, parental, and/or social pressure. How do they affect you or someone you know? You will be referring to two of the readings you wrote about last week. For this HW assignment, write at least an 8-sentence paragraph regarding a personal and/or observational example about a specific incident that an outside influence pressured you or someone else (put in a name, even if you make it up). This is considered a creative writing assignment to prepare you for the upcoming essay due this Thursday. Read Melany Hunt’s student essay “Medium Ash Brown,” pages 270-272 in the 14th edition and pages 269-270 in the 15th edition, for inspiration and to see how she uses concrete, specify details, names, places, personal quotes.   If you have an E-book, this student essay can be found in Chapter 9/Process, or use Google Books.

B. Write one personal quote you or someone else said. You can make it up. See page 52 (#5) and/or page 59 bottom (#4).  
Here are two examples:                                                                                       
1.) I yelled at my older sister Pam, “No! I’m not going to lie for you.”  
2.) My friend Paul said, “Let’s take those bottles of water. No one’s looking.”

C.  Punctuation review! Follow the guidelines on page 100 in the 14th edition and page 102 in the 15th edition (Chapter 6/Narration) and write a one sentence example for “Five Ways to Correct These Errors” (fused sentences and comma splices). Also, you can just follow my five examples given below.  Remember, a comma splice is a punctuation error caused when two sentences are connected solely by a comma, which is too weak.
Here is my example of a comma splice, which contains a comma error: John runs down the street everyday, he is training for a race. 
The comma is too weak for this sentence.   Below are five different ways I fixed my comma splice.  Now, you show me your sentence and how you can fix it five different ways.   You can use the same sentence though each will have a different structure.  
Here are my five examples of how I fixed my above comma splice:     
1.) John runs down the street every day. He is training for a race.	(Period)
2.) John runs down the street every day, for he is training for a race.   (FANBOYS: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so)    
3.) John runs down the street every day; he is training for a race.  (Semicolon = period)       
4.) John runs down the street every day; in fact, he is training. (Semicolon; transitional phrase, sentence)        
5.) John runs down the street every day because he is training.  ((Subordination is the weak part of the sentence: because...	if.... )                                                         
*Note: For #4, there is a list of transitional words and phrases on page 55 (page 56 in the 15th edition), which is in the middle of Chapter 3/Arrangement.   For #5, there is a list of subordinating conjunctions at the top of page 536 (page 540 in the 15th edition, in the middle of Chapter 14/Argumentation) and examples of their usage, or you can Google these terms.

## Part A 
I started to study the Bible and soon believed Jesus as my personal savior in my second year of college when I studied in Taiwan. At that time, many of my classmates viewed Christianity as a foreign intrusion to the local cultures, so being a new Christian student in my boarding school was not an easy life. During the meal, I often found the chicken drumstick in my plate disappeared after I opened my eyes after saying grace with my eyes closed. My meal mates just like to prank me. I thank God that His words are faithful and bring peace into my life that allow me to withstand the pressures from the mocking of my classmates. Many of my roommates commented that I spent too much time reading the Bible while they studied the textbook. But my detailed and persistent daily Bible reading actually helps me to learn my textbook more effectively. Eventually, I graduated with first rank in the major department among a total of more than a hundred students. It is a blessing to be a Jesus follower, regardless of the peer pressure from my classmates againsting that. 

## Part B. Write one personal quote
“What you learn from your college courses will decide the quality of food you may enjoy in the rest of your life”, my wise mother advised me while she sent me away to college.

## C.  Punctuation review!
