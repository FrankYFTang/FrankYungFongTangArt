# EWRT1A Homework 3

A. Read Martin Gansberg’s “Thirty-Eight Who Saw Murder Didn’t Call the Police” pages 126-129 in the 14th edition, pages 127-30 in the 15th edition. If you have an E-book, this essay can be found in Chapter 6/Narration.  Write a summary sentence in which you mention the essay title in quotes, the author’s complete name, and the author’s message/thesis.
Here is an example:  Martin Gansberg, in his essay “Thirty-Eight Who Saw Murder Didn’t Call the Police,” wrote about a murder in 1964 when numerous people witnessed a woman being stabbed, yet they failed to get involved.
Then, copy three quotes from his Gansberg’s essay, citing the page number the quote is found, and write a brief personal comment about your selected quote.
Here is an example: Gansberg stated, “the ‘good people’ failed to call the police” (127). Unfortunately, this happens way too much in our society.
*Note: Single quotes are always used inside of double quotes..

B. Read Laura Bobnak’s “The Price of Silence” pages 76-78 in the 14th edition, pages 78-80 in the 15th edition. This student essay can be found at the end of Chapter 4/Drafting and Revising.  Write a summary sentence in which you mention this student’s essay title in quotes, the author’s complete name, and the author’s message/thesis. Note above example with Gansberg.
Then, copy three quotes from Bobnak’s essay, citing the page number the quote is found, and then write a brief personal comment about your selected quote. Again, see the Ganberg example above.  *Note:  If you have trouble locating Bobnak's essay in your Reader, try Google Books.    In your Reader, "The Price of Silence" is at the end of Chapter 4: Drafting and Revising "Sample Student Essay." 

C.  Comma Exercise!  Please copy the following ten sentences putting one or two commas where they belong.  The number of commas required per sentence is listed in parenthesis after each sentence.

## Part A:
In the article “Thirty-Eight Who Saw Murder Didn’t Call the Police”, Martin Gansberg reported the incident of the killing of Kitty Genovese and his interviews with many who eyewitnessed the event without calling the police.  
1. Gansberg noted “This is what the police say happened beginning at 3:20 A.M.  in the staid, middle-cIass, tree-lined Austin Street area” (127) and provided us a clearer view of the stage of this event. It happened in very early morning, “3:20 A.M.”, while most people should be asleep. Also, it happened in a location that these “tree-line” may easily block the clear viewing for anyone from the upper floors in the surrounding residents. 
1. Gansberg suggested one of the neighbors saw what happened with his writing “She screamed. Lights went on in the ten-story apartment house at 82-67. Austin Street, which faces the bookstore. Windows slid open and voices punctured the early-morning stillness” (127). Notice that the apartment has ten stories and Gansberg did not tell us which floor this neighbor is located. He could be on the first floor or on the tenth floor, which the vision from the viewing point is most likely blocked by the “tree-line” of that street. Gansberg also mentioned the “Lights went on” that create an illusion that would illuminate the murder scene but if we think carefully a light turned on inside such an unit will have no effect to make the stabbing scene bright enough to be seen clearly by the neighbor. Gansberg also emphasized that the neighbor did slide the Window open and speak out, but that still does not mean that neighbor saw the event with visual contact. He could just hear the screaming from a girl and call out. If I live on the tenth floor and a girl is screaming across the street from the unit I am sleeping at 3:30 A.M. , I will probably open the window, without finding my glasses  to wear and ask whoever is outside to be quiet and won’t bother to figure out what really happens outside in the darkness below the tree. 
1. Gansberg further illustrated the difficulty of seeing the event according to one of the interviews “‘We went to the window to see what was happening,’ he said, ‘but the light from our bedroom made it difficult to see the street.’ The wife, still apprehensive, added: ‘I put out the light and we were able to see better’”. This helps us to understand when the neighbor turns on their light to look outside, the brightness of the light inside their unit will actually prevent them from seeing the scene in the darkness. Notice the wife didn’t say they see the event clearly after she put out the light, she only mentioned they will be able to see the scene “better”, which could still be very unclear, just better than with their light on.

## Part B:

In her essay “The Price of Silence”, Laura Bobnak, now a college student, reflected on how she handled the incident that she saw her friend Jeff cheated and passed the Advanced Placement Chemistry test and what would she do differently now after she read the Henry Louis Gates Jr.’s article. 
1. Bobnak admitted “Now that I am in college, however, I see the situation differently. I find it hard to believe that I could ever have been so complacent about cheating” (77) and pointed out she now grew more maturely after studying in college. The college education helped her to see a bigger picture of what would happen to a person after they took a shortcut to cheat out some important aspect of their life.
1. Bobnak also pointed out that “I gave in to peer pressure instead of doing what I knew to be right” (77). She reflected and admitted that she failed Jeff under the peer pressure even though she already consciously knows the steps she avoided are not in the best interest for Jeff in the long run. 
1. Bobnak listed some questions she considered after she started college “What, … are the implications of cheating? What would happen to the educational system if cheating became the norm? What are my obligations to all those who are involved in education? Aren’t teachers and students interested in achieving a common goal?” (77) to prompt the readers to consider the issue from a bigger picture point of view. She started to challenge the value system of all readers and suggested that our nonintervention may come with a severe cost harming our community.
