# EWRT1A Homework 8

A.   Construct your possible Works Cited page for your upcoming Research paper. Use your two researched articles you competed in HW #7 (you can change them or add more). Include King (shown below in example Works Cited). Thus, there will be a minimum of three entries in your Works Cited. Refer again to the research model given in the reader pages 757-758. Plus, you can refer to Purdue Owl for correct MLA.
 Also, review the structure from the MLA Works Cited on pages 757-758 that you just did in +20 HW #7A. Note indentation and that you need to include the URL and a date. If no date is given, after the URL put Accessed on 28 Oct. 2023. See MLA examples on pages 739-749 14th edition, (beginning of Chapter 18), pages 732-742 15th edition, or google Purdue Owl on the internet.  
Be sure your Works Cited entries are in ABC order according to author’s last name or "article title" if there is no author. Follow correct indentation also demonstrated in the reader’s Works Cited: first line flush left.  (Again, see pages 757-758 in Chapter 18.)
*Note:  Please review student MLA Works Cited example with two extra entries below, after B.  You need only three.

B.   Show how each of your three Works Cited entries could look in your essay.  There are basically two ways:
According to King, “Quote” (560).    
OR  	“Quote” (King 560).   Only mention an author's name ONCE per sentence.       See pages 737-740 in your reader. Remember your HW # 7 A  and how the student writer did his (pp. 750-758 in 14th edition, pp. 743-751 in 15th edition) at the end of Chapter 18.
