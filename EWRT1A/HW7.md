# EWRT1A Homework 7
A.   Note the MLA Works Cited model in your Patterns for College Writing reader pages 757-758 (end of Chapter 18).  There are 17 entries listed under the Works Cited on pages 757-758, pages 750-751 in the 15th edition.    Number 1-17 and show how each ABC entry listed in the Works Cited could look inside a research essay.  Each of your examples must include either the author's last name or "article title," whichever is listed first in each Works Cited entry.  Either write out the author's name or article title OR just put the author's last name or "article title" in parenthesis.  See the six examples below.  If you are unsure, note how the 17 entries are cited inside the essay “The Limitations of Wikipedia” located pages 750-755, immediately before the Works Cited.
Here are six examples done for you:
1. "Quote" (Chozick).	*author’s last name only is needed
2.  "Quote" (Cohen).     *author's last name only
4.  "Quote" (“Gender Bias”).   *no author: article title only
11.  "Quote" (“Neutral Point of View”).	*no author: article title only
14.  Rowan Scarborough notes, "Quote."    *author's name written out before the quote or paraphrase
15.  "Quote" (Torrenzano and Davis 53). 	*two authors with a page number
Now you only have 11 to do!  Do note how each in-essay citation is only mentioned once per sentence.
*Note:  If you do not have the book or are unable to locate this particular page, you can Google the following: MLA Sample Works Cited Page Purdue OWL.
On that page is a sample Works Cited with 13 entries, the first being Dean.   The second entry is Ebert.  When you get to #9, ---. means the author listed immediately above, so it would be "(Nordhaus "Global Warming Economics").  Only do these if you are unable to access the Patterns for College Writing book.
 
B.  Research two articles on the internet either for and/or against your selected social law or issue that bothers you that you mentioned in HW #9. You can change your mind in the future if you want. For each of your two articles, write a four sentence summary that includes at least one quote.
*Note:  If you really like the articles you just summarized, save as much of the following information so you can use it for HW # 11 when you will construct a potential Works Cited for your upcoming research paper:     Author. "Title of Article." Title of Source/Magazine, Version? Number? Publisher? Publication or Accessed Date, Internet Address/domain.
 
C.   Avoid Comma Splices!  Copy and correct the ten comma splices below.  Remember, the main comma is too weak, so each sentence needs either a period, semi colon, or FANBOYS (for, and, no, but, or, yet, so).  If you are confused about comma splices (also called run-ons or fused sentences), please Google.  There are examples given in your reader on page 100 (Chapter 6/Narration).

### Article 1:
Stern, Mark Joseph. “The Strange Constitutional Loophole Exposed by Dianne Feinstein’s Replacement.” Slate Magazine, Slate, 2 Oct. 2023, slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/10/california-new-senator-laphonza-butler-maryland-residency.html. 
Summary: Butler's appointment to the Senate seat vacated by Feinstein's death has raised questions about whether she fulfills the constitutional prerequisite of being an "inhabitant" of California. The Constitution is hazy on whether this requirement applies to appointed senators, and there are lines of reasoning to be argued on both sides. Ultimately, the Senate will determine whether to admit Butler's qualifications, and they are likely to do so given the Democratic majority. This case highlights the limitations of the Constitution in addressing modern political issues.

### Article 2:
```
King, Ryan. “Gavin Newsom’s Pick for California Senator, Laphonza Butler... Lives in Maryland.” 
        New York Post, New York Post, 4 Oct. 2023, 
        nypost.com/2023/10/02/maryland-resident-laphonza-butler-to-be-california-senator/. 
```
#### Summary:
California Governor Gavin Newsom appointed Laphonza Butler, a resident of Maryland and president of Emily's List, to fill the Senate spot vacated by the late Dianne Feinstein. The appointment has drawn criticism due to Butler's residency, but she has deep ties to California and has re-registered to vote there. She is expected to be sworn in this week and may also run for the seat in the 2024 election. Her appointment could benefit Newsom politically, given Emily's List's influence in Democratic politics.
