# EWRT1A Homework 9
A.    Write an 8-10 sentence Introduction regarding the social issue or law that bothers you. Remember, you can be creative, use personal or cited quotes, personal examples and/or observations, definitions, historical perspectives, future possibilities (Imagine…), questions that you answer.
Remember, you do not support your introduction: you support your thesis statement, which is the last sentence of your Introductory paragraph.  Note the two possible thesis statements below in Part B.
This is just a practice. Hopefully, though, you will be able to use this for your upcoming Research Essay (Essay 2). You can, of course, change it.

B.    State at least one reason (one sentence at least) why someone would not agree with your above thesis. Remember how the student writer did this in Ramos’s essay on page 538 (14th edition), page 542 (15th edition), paragraph 5, in Chapter 14.     
Here are two possible thesis statements:           
1.  Our society needs to help the homeless population so they can then help themselves.      
2.  Our society should let the homeless population figure their situation out on their own and stop assisting them.
*Note how #1 contradicts #2 and vice versus.   These are examples of opposing viewpoints.

## Part A

On October 1, 2023, California Governor Newsom chose Laphonza Butler to fill the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by the death of Dianne Feinstein to represent California (Marzorati). Before this appointment, Butler was a Maryland resident, not a California resident although she lived and worked in the state of California between 2009 and 2021, and she still owns a house in California (Smith). The US Constitution states that each state of the United States elect two senators to represent the state. The elected senators are representing the citizens of their state and seeking for the best interest of their state. The office of Governor Newsom states that Butler would re-register as California resident before she takes office. In a regular election of US Senator, a candidate will be the resident of that statue to be listed on the ballot based on the restriction stated in Article I, Section 3, Clause 3 of the US Constitution. Since Butler is not elected through a regular US Senator general election but by the state governor’s temporary seat appointment, Governor Newsom believes he can make such an appointment as long as Butler re-register as a California resident before she takes office. However, such interpretation violates the frame’s intent that requires the appointee to only those “when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen” to serve as the senator of that state (“Constitution of the United States,” art. 1, sec. 4). Therefore, it should be unconstitutional to allow a state governor to appoint a resident of another state to serve as the temporary senator to represent their state.

## Part B

### Reason 1:
The US Constitution only requires that senators be "inhabitants" of the state that they represent and Butler would re-register to vote in California before she swore-in to take office as a senator. Therefore, it is constitutional for a state governor to appoint any resident of another state to serve as the temporary senator to represent their state as long as they re-register to vote in that state before they swear-in to take office as a senator.

### Reason 2:
Butler lived in and served as public servant for California between 2009 and 2021, and she still owns a house in California even after she moved to Maryland in 2021. She contributed a lot to the state of California while she served as the public servant and have long term contribution to our community even though she moved out to Maryland two years ago. Therefore, it should be constitutional for a state governor to appoint any resident of another state to serve as the temporary senator to represent their state as long as they had previously lived in that state for a long time and still own a house in that state because that fulfill the “an Inhabitant of that State” requirement.
