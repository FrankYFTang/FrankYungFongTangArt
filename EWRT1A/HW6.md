# EWRT1A Homework 6
A.    Read Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail” pages 558-570 (14th edition) and pages 562-574 (15th edition) in your Patterns for College Writing.   For those of you who have an E-book, this powerful essay can be found in Chapter 14/Argumentation.  King's essay is 12 pages long, so plan your time accordingly. Copy and cite five of King’s quotes; then, write a personal comment after each cited quote. There are three correct quote citation drop-ins on page 536 (Chapter 14) of your reader for reference.                                   
Here is an example:   According to King, “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere” (559). I never really thought of this before. I only used to think of injustice happening to me, my friends, or family.

## Part A

“Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere” (King 559). Injustice is contagious just like all other sinful nature of mankind is contagious. The Bible said “And what does the Lord require of you But to do justice, to love kindness, And to walk humbly with your God” (Micah 6:8). Mr. King knows the mission of his life is to “do justice” and there is no way for him to ignore injustice, even if he was not living in that city. This is something I also feel strongly about. No matter where such injustice is- in China, India, Iran, or North Korea- that is all “a threat to justice everywhere”. 

“We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny” (King 559). Mr. King viewed the whole Civil Right movement as a national, probably even an universal movement for human rights. He knew the mutuality inside the society connected him to every other citizen of the United States of America. He argued he has no position to not be concerned about the human rights of others, since his life, as all of ours, were tied together inseparable. As today, we should feel the same way while we see the human rights of many people inside China and Hong Kong got violated by the party dictatorship of the Chinese Communist Party. We are also connected to them “tied in a single garment of destiny”.

“Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds” (King 559). Mr. King argued he should not be considered as an outsider since he lives inside the United States. That is very true. Many illegal immigrants arrived in our country via either illegal ways while others entered legally but illegally overstayed after their visa expired. Nonetheless, since they lives inside the United State, we shall never considered them as an outsider just like we should not consider Mr. King as an outsider in Birmingham. 

“The purpose of our direct-action program is to create a situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation” (King 561). Mr. clearly denotes the concept that the final goal of their direct-action is to reach the condition for negotiation. It is very true in many conditions that the one who has power has no interest to negotiate since they do not need to. It is therefore critical for the powerless to motivate the powerful to negotiate by creating the concerns and interest that the powerful cannot ignore. Crisis is often the pivot point to turn the table around between the powerful and the powerless. I think Ukraine should eventually attack Moscow to motivate the Russians into negotiation.

“We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.” (King 561). While freedom is often considered as part of basic human rights, it never comes free without someone paying the price. The cost of freedom is often high, just got paid by our forefathers many years ago so we seldom sense the high cost they paid for us.  


## Part B
One thing that really bothers me is that on October 1, 2023, California Governor Newsom chose Laphonza Butler, a Maryland resident, not a California resident, to fill the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by the death of Dianne Feinstein to represent California. According to US Constitution Article I, Section 3, Clause 3, the qualifications of US Senator is “No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen.” It is true that according to US Constitution Article I, Section 3, Clause 2 that “if Vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise, [...] the Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the Legislature [...].” which gave Governor Newsom the legal authority to choose the appointment. However, such appointment choice should be limited to not including any person who was upon the time of choosing “an Inhabitant of that State” regardless how fast Ms. Butler re-register to a California resident AFTER she was chosen by Governor Newsom. The US Constitution clearly states the qualification for such decision time is “when elected” if the candidate is voted through general election. By farmers' intent, such qualification should also be applicable when the seat is decided by temporary appointments. Therefore, it should be unconstitutional to allow a state governor to appoint a resident of another state to serve as the temporary senator to represent their state.

## Part C

Newsom's office argued that the US Constitution only requires that senators be "inhabitants" of the state that they represent and Butler would re-register to vote in California before she swore-in to take office as a senator (Marzorati). Others argued Butler lived in and served as public servant for California between 2009 and 2021, and she still Butler owns a house in California even after she moved to Maryland in 2021 qualified her as "inhabitants" of the state of California (Smith).
