# EWRT1A Homework 5

A.   Write at least an 8-sentence Introduction paragraph regarding peer, parental, and/or social pressure. See pages 51-52 for ideas (Chapter 3/Arrangement). This is a creative writing activity to prepare you for your first essay which is due this Thursday. You can give a definition, a personal incident (you can use your example or part of it from +20#4), introduce the two essays you plan to compare, or imagine the future or the past, use personal or cited quotes, historical perspectives, future possibilities (Imagine...), questions that you answer.  In the last sentence of your Introduction, write a possible thesis statement. This must include the topic and your positive and/or negative opinion about it. There are examples of thesis statements on pages 41-42 (Chapter 2/Invention).  You may want to read the student comparison/contrast essay “Brains versus Brawn” that begins on page 378; especially note its Intro, thesis, and Conclusion (Chapter 11/Comparison and Contrast). 
*Note student example Introduction and thesis statement at the end of this assignment.  
 Here are a few thesis statement examples for your upcoming essay:
 
1. Peer pressure is a powerful force that can cause problems.
2. When I was in high school, my best friend John pressured me to join the basketball team, and that made me more self-confident.
3. In my culture, there is pressure to follow certain traditions that I believe are outdated.
4. My parents become angry when I don’t receive an A grade, but I don’t care. Their pressure doesn’t bother me.

Remember, restate your thesis in your essay’s conclusion; plus, you can also tie back to your introduction.

B.  Construct a possible Works Cited page using the two essays out of the six you read last week that you plan to compare in this upcoming essay: see pages 78 (the end of Chapter 18/Documenting Sources: MLA) and 443 (The Works Cited at the end of the student essay "What I Learned ... in College" found in Chapter12/Classification and Division).  Be sure your authors are listed in ABC order: note p. 757.  A model for ABC order and authors’ last names is in the Index pages 791-810 located at the back of your reader.    Here is an example of what your Works Cited should look like:
```

C. Construct a sentence outline for your upcoming essay (refer to Essay 1 requirements); see pages 373-375 (pages 371-373 in the 15th edition) for possible examples (Chapter 11/Structuring a Comparison/Contrast Essay). 

## Part A:

Life is tough! As a student, we all experienced different kinds of pressure. Many of us experience racial stereotypes that strangers in the community expect us differently based on our race and skin color. Compared to other forms of social pressure, the one from racial stereotypes is extremely difficult for us to process since our race is not what we can control and change. In the article “Why Chinese Mothers Are Superior.”, by Yale professor Amy Chua, and “Just Walk On By: A Black Man Ponders His Power to Alter Public Space.”, by Pulitzer Prize winner Brent Staples, the authors discussed challenges of social stereotypes unique to their race. The combination of these two papers provided a way to examine the different expectations youth in these two cultures may experience. In this article, we contrast them in terms of the source of their pressure, the area of the impact, and their long-term consequence. We found that it is much harder to live as an African American student than a Chinese American student in the United States.
