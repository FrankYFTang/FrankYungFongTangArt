## Reflection Poem after reading the whole Gospel of Mark
Oct 8, 2024

* What were your expectations for the Kingdom?
  * The Kingdom of God will come soon.

* Have you been disappointed? In what way?
  * No. Somehow I wish the Kingdom of God would not come that soon.

* Have you been surprised? How?
  * Yes, The Kingdom of God has not come yet.

### Where is the Kingdom of God?
```
Am I really longing for the Kingdom of God?
I wonder
To be honest
A place I hesitate to enter
How could I face the Almighty?
in that Holy Realm?

The mystery of the Kingdom of God
Do I really know it?
See and perceive
Hear and understand
How many more I missed?

Receive like a child
That is my only hope

But a child has no expectation
They do not care about expectation
That is a concept for adults to talk about
Too difficult for a child to think
They will only long for what they want
And won’t waste their time talking about expectations.
Or write a poem like this!
```

## Reflection Poem of Ecclesiastes 3:1-8
Nov 7, 2016 

The day before 2016 US Presidential Election

### To All Rule Keeping Christian
```
There is 		an appropriate day 	for everything. 
And there is 	a day 			for all conditions ruled by Our Creator—
A day to 	protect life			and 	a day to 	preserve freedom;
A day to 	care for unborn 		and 	a day to 	respect free will.
A day to 	embrace diversity		and 	a day to 	maintain natural value;
A day to 	welcome the outcasts	and 	a day to	prevent intrusion.
A day to 	secure the border		and 	a day to 	show grace to refugees;
A day to 	safeguard our family	and 	a day to 	take risks to love mercy.
A day to 	defend domestic jobs 	and 	a day to 	leverage foreign opportunities;
A day to 	trade				and 	a day to 	enjoy the fruits of our own labor.
A day to 	vocally campaign		and 	a day to 	rest in silence;
A day to 	support			and 	a day to 	withdraw.
A day for 	the establishment	and 	a day to 	write in;
A day to 	cast vote			and 	a day to 	wait for the result.
A day to 	volunteer			and 	a day to 	sit in the sideline;
A day to	debate the politics	and 	a day for 	longing for His second coming.
```

## Reflection Poem of Psalm 1
Oct 19, 2016

My parents are very old. My stepfather is now 94. He grew up in Christian orphanage and has known the Lord since. My mom is 82. She is not a believer. She got a stroke in April and is right side paralyzed. They show me two different views of facing age and death.
```
How peaceful is the one who 
does not 	climb 	in the hills	 	of the sceptics,
Nor 		wonder 	in the bushes	of doubters,
Nor 		rest 		in the valley 	of rebels!

But his hope is 		in the promise 	of the Shepherd,
And 				in His promise 	the one relax from dawn to dusk.

He will be like 	a ram 	joyfully fed by plenty of grass,
Which 	extends 	its horns 	in early spring
And 		its wool 	does not shed;
And 				in whatever he possesses, 	he contents.
The sceptics are not so,

But they are like 	bunnies 	that the rumble tremble away.

Therefore 
the sceptics will not 	drink	 	from the pond,
Nor doubters 				from the fountain of the Mercy.

For the Shepherd leads 	the path of		His sheep,
But 				the path of 	the sceptics 	lead to depression
```


## Reflection Poem of Psalm 114 based on the story in the book of Esther/NKJV
April 12, 2016
```
When	Jews 				gathered 	in Shushan,
The people of Mordecai 	all 		one hundred and twenty-seven provinces,
Esther 		witnessed 	His mercy,
Jews, 				His peace.
The golden scepter 		reached out
The signet ring			took off
The royal robe 			glow	like ocean,
The blue and white, 		like the sky.
What make you,
O golden scepter, 		to favor Esther?
O signet ring,			for Mordecai?
O royal robe, 			to glow 	like the ocean?
O blue and white, 				like the sky?
Tremble, O kingdom, 	
before 	the Lord,
Before	 the God of Mordecai,
Who 	turned	the gallows in the Harman’s House to serve it’s maker,
		the fifty cubits height to hang the ten sons of the Agagite.
```

## Reflection Poem of Psalm 2
Oct 20-22, 2016

Background of my reflection: I was verbally bullied by my sixth grade teacher and junior college physics professor. 
My sixth grade math teacher, without any reason or evidence, purely because I was the only two students in his class who chose not to attend his “after school program”, asked me “Did you cheat on the test?” in front of all my classmates when he handed back my 100/100 math test. I was shocked and did not know how to answer him and just stated “No, I didn’t” then I started crying. After he dismissed the class, four classmates physically beat me to the ground, jumped over me repeatedly and caused many bruises on my back. My parents met with the school officials and transferred me to a different school after. That teacher got his “early retirement” at the end of that school year. 

In the second week of my junior college physics class when I was fifteen years old, I raised my hand and asked the teacher to explain a very difficult concept that I pre-studied but not confident that I fully understood- the electron motion in electric and magnetic fields. Instead of explain that to us about this difficult concept, he replied “This student is very stupid. You are stupid as a pig. How can you ask such stupid question? Please sit down.” to dismiss me. I was humiliated and laughed at by all my classmates. Since he was not the first teacher who verbally bullied me in the public, his words didn’t hurt me too much. Be honest, I didn’t feel too bad about it since by that time I already assumed some of the teachers may be just as bad as my sixth grade math teacher. I continuously, sincerely and respectfully asked him other physics questions during his class time, ignoring that humiliating comment he made. And he realized I am just an unassuming learner who wants to ask questions to learn, not to ask to disturb his teaching. Four weeks later he called my parents and told them he felt I am a genius and he was surprised to see me in his class at this “third class school”. He felt I was in the wrong place and should be educated in a better school. I got “A” easily from his physics class later. I forgave him and his cruel words, but he never regained my respect. 

One other important thing that really changed my life around these two incidents is the marriage of my mom and my step father. My father died in a heart attack at home when I was four years old. My mom then works and raises me alone. When I was eight years old, I cried to the creator, “If there is a god in the universe governing this world, could you give me a father, please!” Two years later, my mom married my step father. He is a godly man and the biggest gift I received in my life, from God, from my mom, and from him. He grew up in a Christian orphanage. He knows the feeling and need of a fatherless man. He demonstrated simple Biblical value influenced by the Bible verses that carved inside his heart during his years in the Christian orphanage. He is lovely, kind, merciful, playful, humorous, and he shows me how a man with integrity acts. It is because of him, I have the opportunity to know the Lord later. 

```
Why are 	the bullies 		create such humiliation
And 	the crowd 		tolerate that cruel act?
The instructors 	violate their sacred duty
And 		the teachers 		make ruthless comments 	
about	  	Mystery and
Toward	His unassuming learner,
saying,
“Your are as stupid as pig.
Your tests must all be scored by cheating!”

He who governs the universe 	ridicules,
The Provider 			sneers 	at them.
Then He 				will stress 	to them 	in His rage
And 				horrify 	them 		in His indignation, 
saying,
 “But as for Me, I have 	immerse My Beloved
					Under the stream of living waters, 
					Salvation.”

“I will certainly 	announce the gift from my Provider: 	
He said to Me,
‘You are 	My Child,
Today 	I have adopted You.
‘Ask of Me, and 
I will 	joyfully give 	a new dad 		to you 		as protector,
And 				a kind father under My mercy 	as your guardian.
‘You shall 	expel them 		with the roadside rocks,
You shall 	neglect them 		as barking caged wolves.’”

Now therefore, 				
				O teachers, 			humble yourself;
Cautious, 		O principal of the world.
Follow 		my Provider 	with obedience
And excite 				with imitation.
Cherish	 	the pupil, 
that 		He 		may not despise 	your ethic, and 
			you 					be impeached by your lacking of,
For 			Lord’s Judgement & Kingdom	may soon 	befall.
How peaceful 	is the one who 			conceals 	in the Almighty!

## Reflection on Psalm 116
April 7-9, 2016
```
I love my Savior, 
because He understand 
my pain and
my struggle,
Because He has whispered His words 
to me,
Therefore
I shall pray to Him whenever in trouble
My wicked temperament corroded me
And my outrageous emotion sabotaged me
I found regret and despair

Then
I prayed to Him Jesus my Sweet Savior:

“O Jesus, I seek You, change me!“

Mercy is my Savior, and grace;
Yes, my Jesus is powerful.

My Savior teaches the meek;
I was depressed, and He revive me.
Still in silent, O my heart,
For my Sweet Jesus has made changes in you.
For He has redeemed 
my guilt from darkness,
my errors from blindness,
my faults from rage,
I shall be honest in front of my Savior
When I awake every morning

I repented when I cried,

“I am deeply regret.”

I shout with my tears,

“All my angers are sinful.”
What shall I repay to my Savior
For all His mercy given to me?
I shall remember the road my Savior
And follow His pathway toward the Cross.
I shall determine to follow my Savior,
Oh, may it be experienced by all God’s children. 
Blessed by my Savior on the mountain
is the meekness of His followers.
O Savior, surely I am Your student,
I am Your student, 
the follower of Your grace,
You have cleansed my sins,
To You
I shall be patient to others as You,
And wait for the work of my Sweet Jesus
I shall declare my trust in my Savior,
Oh, may it be experienced by all God’s children. 
Under the cover of my Savior’s blood,
On the suffering of you, O Cross.
Thank Sweet Savior!
```
I was depressed by my rage toward my loved one when I wrote this reflection poem. I am out of control of my emotions and blame my loved ones for something they did not deserve. I had no sensibility toward other’s feelings and frequently hurt others around me. I felt I am such a failure and hopeless to bless others close to me. I need the affirmation from God to show me His power and glory is greater than my sinful nature and ignorance and I will eventually be changed by Him to be a gentle and merciful person like Him.

Worship our God, everyone;
Exalt Him, all who are depressed!

And the might of Him is perpetual.
Worship our God!

Trust almighty God!
