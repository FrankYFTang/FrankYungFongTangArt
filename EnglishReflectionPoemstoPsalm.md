## Reflection Poem of Psalm 114 based on the story in the book of Esther/NKJV
April 12, 2016
```
When	Jews 				gathered 	in Shushan,
The people of Mordecai 	all 		one hundred and twenty-seven provinces,
Esther 		witnessed 	His mercy,
Jews, 				His peace.
The golden scepter 		reached out
The signet ring			took off
The royal robe 			glow	like ocean,
The blue and white, 		like the sky.
What make you,
O golden scepter, 		to favor Esther?
O signet ring,			for Mordecai?
O royal robe, 			to glow 	like the ocean?
O blue and white, 				like the sky?
Tremble, O kingdom, 	
before 	the Lord,
Before	 the God of Mordecai,
Who 	turned	the gallows in the Harman’s House to serve it’s maker,
		the fifty cubits height to hang the ten sons of the Agagite.
