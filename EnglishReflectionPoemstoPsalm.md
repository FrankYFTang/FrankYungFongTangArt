## Reflection Poem of Psalm 114 based on the story in the book of Esther/NKJV
April 12, 2016
```
When	Jews 				gathered 	in Shushan,
The people of Mordecai 	all 		one hundred and twenty-seven provinces,
Esther 		witnessed 	His mercy,
Jews, 				His peace.
The golden scepter 		reached out
The signet ring			took off
The royal robe 			glow	like ocean,
The blue and white, 		like the sky.
What make you,
O golden scepter, 		to favor Esther?
O signet ring,			for Mordecai?
O royal robe, 			to glow 	like the ocean?
O blue and white, 				like the sky?
Tremble, O kingdom, 	
before 	the Lord,
Before	 the God of Mordecai,
Who 	turned	the gallows in the Harman’s House to serve it’s maker,
		the fifty cubits height to hang the ten sons of the Agagite.

## Reflection Poem of Psalm 2
Oct 20-22, 2016

Background of my reflection: I was verbally bullied by my sixth grade teacher and junior college physics professor. 
My sixth grade math teacher, without any reason or evidence, purely because I was the only two students in his class who chose not to attend his “after school program”, asked me “Did you cheat on the test?” in front of all my classmates when he handed back my 100/100 math test. I was shocked and did not know how to answer him and just stated “No, I didn’t” then I started crying. After he dismissed the class, four classmates physically beat me to the ground, jumped over me repeatedly and caused many bruises on my back. My parents met with the school officials and transferred me to a different school after. That teacher got his “early retirement” at the end of that school year. 

In the second week of my junior college physics class when I was fifteen years old, I raised my hand and asked the teacher to explain a very difficult concept that I pre-studied but not confident that I fully understood- the electron motion in electric and magnetic fields. Instead of explain that to us about this difficult concept, he replied “This student is very stupid. You are stupid as a pig. How can you ask such stupid question? Please sit down.” to dismiss me. I was humiliated and laughed at by all my classmates. Since he was not the first teacher who verbally bullied me in the public, his words didn’t hurt me too much. Be honest, I didn’t feel too bad about it since by that time I already assumed some of the teachers may be just as bad as my sixth grade math teacher. I continuously, sincerely and respectfully asked him other physics questions during his class time, ignoring that humiliating comment he made. And he realized I am just an unassuming learner who wants to ask questions to learn, not to ask to disturb his teaching. Four weeks later he called my parents and told them he felt I am a genius and he was surprised to see me in his class at this “third class school”. He felt I was in the wrong place and should be educated in a better school. I got “A” easily from his physics class later. I forgave him and his cruel words, but he never regained my respect. 

One other important thing that really changed my life around these two incidents is the marriage of my mom and my step father. My father died in a heart attack at home when I was four years old. My mom then works and raises me alone. When I was eight years old, I cried to the creator, “If there is a god in the universe governing this world, could you give me a father, please!” Two years later, my mom married my step father. He is a godly man and the biggest gift I received in my life, from God, from my mom, and from him. He grew up in a Christian orphanage. He knows the feeling and need of a fatherless man. He demonstrated simple Biblical value influenced by the Bible verses that carved inside his heart during his years in the Christian orphanage. He is lovely, kind, merciful, playful, humorous, and he shows me how a man with integrity acts. It is because of him, I have the opportunity to know the Lord later. 

```
Why are 	the bullies 		create such humiliation
And 	the crowd 		tolerate that cruel act?
The instructors 	violate their sacred duty
And 		the teachers 		make ruthless comments 	
about	  	Mystery and
Toward	His unassuming learner,
saying,
“Your are as stupid as pig.
Your tests must all be scored by cheating!”

He who governs the universe 	ridicules,
The Provider 			sneers 	at them.
Then He 				will stress 	to them 	in His rage
And 				horrify 	them 		in His indignation, 
saying,
 “But as for Me, I have 	immerse My Beloved
					Under the stream of living waters, 
					Salvation.”

“I will certainly 	announce the gift from my Provider: 	
He said to Me,
‘You are 	My Child,
Today 	I have adopted You.
‘Ask of Me, and 
I will 	joyfully give 	a new dad 		to you 		as protector,
And 				a kind father under My mercy 	as your guardian.
‘You shall 	expel them 		with the roadside rocks,
You shall 	neglect them 		as barking caged wolves.’”

Now therefore, 				
				O teachers, 			humble yourself;
Cautious, 		O principal of the world.
Follow 		my Provider 	with obedience
And excite 				with imitation.
Cherish	 	the pupil, 
that 		He 		may not despise 	your ethic, and 
			you 					be impeached by your lacking of,
For 			Lord’s Judgement & Kingdom	may soon 	befall.
How peaceful 	is the one who 			conceals 	in the Almighty!
