# EWRT 2 Critical Reading, Writing and Thinking
I took EWRT 2 Critical Reading, Writing and Thinking in De Anza College during Summer 2024 (July 1 - Auguest 9, 2024). This repo archived my work for this course.
My professor was Margaret Hanzimanolis.

## Essays
### Discussion 1: Introduce Yourself (Grade: 12/10)
* Feedback from Professor: Wow, such an interesting story of your life. The Bible is indeed knowledge in "story form"--so that is a great example of how narratives themselves are important in how we present and defend ideas.
### Discussion # 2: Conceptualizing topics (Grade: 11/10)
* Feedback from Professor: Bonus point: great contribution, Frank
### Discussion # 3: Brainstorming and collaborating on problem / solution papers  (Grade: 19.5/20)
* Feedback from Professor:
  * I totally love the dog sharing idea. I think that is a winner. = I wonder if you could make a "longer term" commitment--something like co-owned dogs? this app idea does seem to be promising though.... but few people would trust random internet strangers with their dogs, would they?
  * Hold off for a few days and see what your group members say--in any case this is a "private enterprise" project either way. a business idea--not a policy change or governmental "taskforce"
  * we have decided on the grid, I think, right?
### Discussion # 4: Refining ideas and giving feedback (Grade: 21/20)
* Feedback from Professor: Again, you have far exceeded the expectations for this assignment. Well done, Frank.
### Discussion # 5: wordiness (Grade: 9.5/10)
* Feedback from Professor: Great revisions.

### Informal Writing # 1: Reading Galeano (Grade: 5/5)
* Feedback from Professor: Not sure of the biblical arguments, but I believe you missed something in your analysis of the first one: he is speaking of those USING Jesus or Jesus's name to kill, torture, and/or oppress others, also a very common strain of the early colonial period in africa and south america. Jesus was "oppressed" ie crucified. and, yet. some people "use his name" to oppress others. That seems to me a useful irony to point out (whatever "using the name" actually means) so the irony adheres to the oppressors in the entry, not to Jesus himself or any Biblical record, I think.

### Informal Writing #2: proposal for the Problem/solution project (Grade: 9.5/10)
* Feedback from Professor: As I have indicated, this idea is already been implemented, from what I can see online. You may have a small new idea, but my understanding is that you will do the grid project, which I think is more innovative!
### Informal Writing #3: Solutions (Grade: 9.5/10)
* Feedback from Professor:  Great project, Frank! You do not need a works cited in
this project: it is precisely NOT an academic paper. You can have a list of references at the end. but no in-text citations or works cited page. Hyperlinks to critical data might be useful.

### Informal Writing #4: What has happened to creativity? A critique of educational systems (Grade: 10/10)
* Feedback from Professor: wow, if this is great. you will dull your knife blade if you cut into a brick. I go geocaching (finding) with my grandchildrenm sometimes.

### Formal Paper 1 Narrative (Grade: 93/100)
* Feedback from Professor:
  * Great narrative, Youngfong! I especially like the vivid details in the cooking paragraph. I don't think the link is working and your place /people descriptions could be strengthened a bit, but otherwise this is great. Are you taking the watercolor class at de anza? I cannot find one open during summer term.
  * Glad you did, but I have almost 60 students, so I want to get through everyone's papers first, before I reread anything. BTW, in future papers, take out the line spacing between paragraphs.
  * The link works now, but I would have preferred a link to a related site--such as wikipedia uses to link readers to useful definitions or more information.
  * The quality is not important :), as I indicated. it is important that you link to a website related to your paper: a website, not a work-related list of codes and files-- I was alarmed that you had sent me a virus, as iI scanned the word "expose" and "github" was vaguely menacing, unfamiliar. Why not link to the Christian club website? a website describing Terriers? The Challenger school? Stevens Creek Reservoir?
That is what I had in mind. And that is what you will need to do for your next paper! Galeano . oh darn. I can't do a hyperlink in this comment box. I will be providing an example later in the week for everyone. Keep an eye out for it.


### Formal Paper 2 Galeano mini-research paper (Grade: 99/100)
* Feedback from Professor: I am floored. This is such a great paper, Frank, way in excess of what was required. I don't know how you did it! Big kudos!! The best I have read so far. Would you let me use it in a video I am going to make on the paper writing process tomorrow for your class and my other one? This is really spectacularly argued.
### Formal Paper 3 Problem/Solution project (Grade: 116/120)
* Feedback from Professor: Good idea to copyright it! It is a brilliant idea. Some minor writing issues, and a bit of a wavering in the audience/who you are: I now get that you are a member of the curriculum committee for de anza's art class, but 115 seems to me that would be the entity to "approve" of your idea, rather than the entity advancing it. Not sure. You could be recommending to the art curriculum committee (not you) that they adopt this as a feature of their "course outline of record" In that scenario, you would be an individual proposing that the art department adopt this formally as part of its curriculum, rather than merely "use" it. In any case, it is truly brilliant, original and I think potentially very useful and doable! I am not quite certain of "who" this should go to in "real life" (and I think it iS a marketable idea)--but for the purposes of this project, the curriculum committee either as target audience or originator of idea is fine.
### Formal Paper 4 Transfer Essay OR Reflection (Grade: 98/100)
* Feedback from Professor: that's a really great first sentence, with the deferred "forte" idea. This is a good opening technique. I also love how you blended the cooking talents and experience with your work with De Anza students and Bible study. This is a fabulous essay, Frank!
