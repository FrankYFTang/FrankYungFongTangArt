# EWRT 2 Critical Reading, Writing and Thinking
I took EWRT 2 Critical Reading, Writing and Thinking in De Anza College during Summer 2024 (July 1 - Auguest 9, 2024). This repo archived my work for this course.
My professor was Margaret Hanzimanolis.

### Formal Paper 1 Narrative (Grade: 93/100)
* Feedback from Professor:
  * Great narrative, Youngfong! I especially like the vivid details in the cooking paragraph. I don't think the link is working and your place /people descriptions could be strengthened a bit, but otherwise this is great. Are you taking the watercolor class at de anza? I cannot find one open during summer term.
  * Glad you did, but I have almost 60 students, so I want to get through everyone's papers first, before I reread anything. BTW, in future papers, take out the line spacing between paragraphs.
  * The link works now, but I would have preferred a link to a related site--such as wikipedia uses to link readers to useful definitions or more information.
  * The quality is not important :), as I indicated. it is important that you link to a website related to your paper: a website, not a work-related list of codes and files-- I was alarmed that you had sent me a virus, as iI scanned the word "expose" and "github" was vaguely menacing, unfamiliar. Why not link to the Christian club website? a website describing Terriers? The Challenger school? Stevens Creek Reservoir?
That is what I had in mind. And that is what you will need to do for your next paper! Galeano . oh darn. I can't do a hyperlink in this comment box. I will be providing an example later in the week for everyone. Keep an eye out for it.

### Formal Paper 2 Galeano mini-research paper (Grade: 99/100)
* Feedback from Professor: I am floored. This is such a great paper, Frank, way in excess of what was required. I don't know how you did it! Big kudos!! The best I have read so far. Would you let me use it in a video I am going to make on the paper writing process tomorrow for your class and my other one? This is really spectacularly argued.
### Formal Paper 3 Problem/Solution project (Grade: 116/120)
* Feedback from Professor: Good idea to copyright it! It is a brilliant idea. Some minor writing issues, and a bit of a wavering in the audience/who you are: I now get that you are a member of the curriculum committee for de anza's art class, but 115 seems to me that would be the entity to "approve" of your idea, rather than the entity advancing it. Not sure. You could be recommending to the art curriculum committee (not you) that they adopt this as a feature of their "course outline of record" In that scenario, you would be an individual proposing that the art department adopt this formally as part of its curriculum, rather than merely "use" it. In any case, it is truly brilliant, original and I think potentially very useful and doable! I am not quite certain of "who" this should go to in "real life" (and I think it iS a marketable idea)--but for the purposes of this project, the curriculum committee either as target audience or originator of idea is fine.
### Formal Paper 4 Transfer Essay OR Reflection (Grade: 98/100)
* Feedback from Professor: that's a really great first sentence, with the deferred "forte" idea. This is a good opening technique. I also love how you blended the cooking talents and experience with your work with De Anza students and Bible study. This is a fabulous essay, Frank!
