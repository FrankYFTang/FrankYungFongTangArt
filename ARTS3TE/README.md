I am taking ARTS 3TE Today's Art Scene in De Anza College during Spring 2025. This repo archived my work for this course. My professor was Julie Hughes.

Amazing. I can tell how curious and hard-working you are. I love it. Keep it up.

I'll put out an announcement about show opportunities later this week.

YOU ARE SO INSPIRING, YUNGFONG!

Thank you for doing such a great job and giving your all. I hope one day you are able to come to Office Hours just to day 'hello.'

In a few weeks, we will start talking about professional practice, which I think you will really like - how to get your work out there, writing statements, etc.

## Goal Setting
 
### Feedback 
This is great and I believe you can make it happen. If you are ever able to come to office hours (even just on Zoom) it would be great because we could talk about your plans.

Does this mean you will be taking the Professional Practice route in the class, or will you be doing a Artist Research Paper?


## Professional Practices Submission (Rough) OR Artist Research Paper

This looks really strong, Frank!


## Maquette
 
### Feedback 

This is excellent, Frank!

I have been thinking... if you end up wanting to include more work in your final exhibition, you could always assign a different value to the model scale. So for example, instead of 1/2-inch = 1-foot, you could make 1/2-inch = 2 feet. 

It would just mean that the print outs of your works would be very small.

Hope that makes sense.
