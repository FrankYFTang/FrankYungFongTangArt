* **Exercise 3-Value Spheres with Graphite & Colored Pencil**
  * **Materials:** graphite pencil, colored pencil, colorless blender, Bristol
  * **Size of spheres:** golf-ball size
  * Use graphite pencil and colored pencil to create 3 value spheres demonstrating 5 characteristics of light and shadow. Apply blending techniques.
    * **Sphere #1:** graphite
    * **Sphere #2:** warm color with colored pencil
    * **Sphere #3:** cool color with colored pencil
* **Assignment 2-Color Schemes with Colored Pencil (10pts)**

  * **Minimum size of drawing:** full page 14X17''. Each color scheme can be around 5-7''
  * **Assignment Instructions:** Look through color magazines and choose a simple image of fruit like cherry, apple, etc. (size around 3”- 4”. Big enough to see details). Use colored pencil to create 4 versions of the image using the following color schemes:
  * **Original** (exact color match)
  * **Monochromatic** (one color plus tints and shades)
  * **Analogous** (3-5 colors adjacent on color wheel plus tints and shades)
  * **Complementary** (1 complementary pair plus tints and shades)
  * **Extra credit (optional):** Neutrals (grays and browns, cool browns, warm browns)
* **Assignment 3-Chalk Pastel Self-portrait with Grid Method (10pts)**
  * We will have our Midterm Critique on this assignment. More instructions will be given.
  * **MATERIALS:** Strathmore/Canson charcoal paper, gray/sand, 19”X25” OR Bristol paper 14X17'' OR white Strathmore paper (400 series, medium surface NOT SMOOTH)18X24'' , graphite pencil, ruler, tape, printed image, chalk pastel, black charcoal pencil, white charcoal pencil, sand paper, Q-tip
  * **SIZE:** taped picture plane, shorter dimension no smaller than 12’’
  * **Assignment Instructions:** Students use the grid method to transfer and enlarge a printed selfie onto toned paper or Bristol. Use chalk pastel to color the drawing SQUARE BY SQUARE. Match the colors shown in image by blending and mixing chalk pastel properly
  * **Steps:**
    * Print out an image of yourself showing identifiable shapes of light and shadow on face
    * Use grid method to transfer and enlarge the image onto toned paper or Bristol with graphite pencil. If you are using Bristol, make it as big as you can. Small drawings are difficult for chalk pastel blocks
    * Draw out the shapes for light and shadow as well (lightly). This will help the coloring step
    * Once drawing in grid is done, tape around the picture plane. LEAVE GRID on paper.
    * Start coloring with chalk pastel ONE SQUARE AT A TIME. Blend different colors with fingers/Q-tips to achieve realistic skin tone. Match colors with image as much as you can, including the background
    * Spray-fix drawing when it’s done. Cover with a sheet of newsprint to protect the drawing
    * Make sure to submit both reference photo and chalk pastel drawing ⬇️
