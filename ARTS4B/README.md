# ARTS 4B Intermediate Drawing

I took ARTS 4B Intermediate Drawing in De Anza College during Fall 2023 (September 25 - December 15, 2023). This repo archived my work for this course. My professor is Meiru Huang.
* **Exercise 1-Cross Contour (2pts)**
  * **Materials:** charcoal pencil/pen on any white paper. Create a contour drawing and add cross contour of your hand posing or holding an object
* **Exercise 2-Value Charts with ink pen & brush**
  * **Materials:** Micron ink pen (05 or 08), black ink, brush (or bamboo brush), palette with wells, jar for water, tape, ruler, pencil, rag/paper towel
  * After watching the demo, practice with ink pen and ink & brush to create 2 value charts showing consistent change of value.
* **Assignment 1-Ink Pen & Ink Wash (10pts)**
  * **Materials:** Micron ink pen, brush and ink on Bristol (vellum surface) OR Strathmore white drawing paper
  * **Minimum size of drawing:** full page. 14X17'' with taped picture plane
* **Exercise 3-Value Spheres with Graphite & Colored Pencil**
  * **Materials:** graphite pencil, colored pencil, colorless blender, Bristol
  * **Size of spheres:** golf-ball size
  * Use graphite pencil and colored pencil to create 3 value spheres demonstrating 5 characteristics of light and shadow. Apply blending techniques.
    * **Sphere #1:** graphite
    * **Sphere #2:** warm color with colored pencil
    * **Sphere #3:** cool color with colored pencil
* **Assignment 2-Color Schemes with Colored Pencil (10pts)**
  * **Materials:** Cut out from magazine, pencil, eraser, ruler, colored pencil on Bristol (can use the back side of Bristol)
  * **Minimum size of drawing:** full page 14X17''. Each color scheme can be around 5-7''
  * **Assignment Instructions:** Look through color magazines and choose a simple image of fruit like cherry, apple, etc. (size around 3‚Äù- 4‚Äù. Big enough to see details). Use colored pencil to create 4 versions of the image using the following color schemes:
  * **Original** (exact color match)
  * **Monochromatic** (one color plus tints and shades)
  * **Analogous** (3-5 colors adjacent on color wheel plus tints and shades)
  * **Complementary** (1 complementary pair plus tints and shades)
  * **Extra credit (optional):** Neutrals (grays and browns, cool browns, warm browns)
* **Assignment 3-Chalk Pastel Self-portrait with Grid Method (10pts)**
  * We will have our Midterm Critique on this assignment. More instructions will be given.
  * **MATERIALS:** Strathmore/Canson charcoal paper, gray/sand, 19‚ÄùX25‚Äù OR Bristol paper 14X17'' OR white Strathmore paper (400 series, medium surface NOT SMOOTH)18X24'' , graphite pencil, ruler, tape, printed image, chalk pastel, black charcoal pencil, white charcoal pencil, sand paper, Q-tip
  * **SIZE:** taped picture plane, shorter dimension no smaller than 12‚Äô‚Äô
  * **Assignment Instructions:** Students use the grid method to transfer and enlarge a printed selfie onto toned paper or Bristol. Use chalk pastel to color the drawing SQUARE BY SQUARE. Match the colors shown in image by blending and mixing chalk pastel properly
  * **Steps:**
    * Print out an image of yourself showing identifiable shapes of light and shadow on face
    * Use grid method to transfer and enlarge the image onto toned paper or Bristol with graphite pencil. If you are using Bristol, make it as big as you can. Small drawings are difficult for chalk pastel blocks
    * Draw out the shapes for light and shadow as well (lightly). This will help the coloring step
    * Once drawing in grid is done, tape around the picture plane. LEAVE GRID on paper.
    * Start coloring with chalk pastel ONE SQUARE AT A TIME. Blend different colors with fingers/Q-tips to achieve realistic skin tone. Match colors with image as much as you can, including the background
    * Spray-fix drawing when it‚Äôs done. Cover with a sheet of newsprint to protect the drawing
    * Make sure to submit both reference photo and chalk pastel drawing ‚¨áÔ∏è
  * **Peer Feedbacks:**
    * From CW: Hello Yungfong! Great work on your piece. The proportions look good. The highlights and details give the portrait depth. The finished product looks clean and well-blended. My only comment would be regarding the color-matching since the colors are a tad more saturated than the original photo.
    * From SS: Hi Frank! First of all, I like the overall attention to detail that you put into your artwork, especially the eyebrow area. The colors look pretty accurate in terms of where the shadows and highlights are, with the warmer yellows being the highlights and the purple being the receding darker areas. I think that your artwork is along the lines of a complementary color scheme because of the dominating yellow and purple hues. I suggest possibly adding more beige to the yellow to make it more accurate based on the original image. Overall, great work!
    * From LS: Hi Yungfong, You did an excellent job on your portrait. I love the variety of colors you've used to get the proper tones. Your work is very life-like, almost a perfect replica of the picture you chose to do. I do believe that some parts of the face that have a bright highlight in the original picture could have been a little more emphazied in my opinion but overall you did an excellent job!
    * From RS: So being frank with you this is really good i like it. it's really on point with the colors. the proportions. it really shows that you have skills. for any feedback, it is hard to think of one. maybe make some parts a bit darkening like the shadows but even then it looks great, good job
    * From AG: Hi Yungfong! Wow, very impressive. I can see many colors within your portrait but they are all well blended. The details within your shirt have texture and depth further pushing that upwards perspective. Overall I believe you did a fantastic job with this new medium.
    * From AC: Hi Yungfong, good job on the colors and values of this piece. You captured the skin tones quite exceptionally. Though the picture is a bit more vibrant than the original I think that adds to the piece and clearly you did it intentionally to add extra flair.
    * From LA: Hi Yungfong, I think your portrait was done very well. There is a lot of details included. Especially when it came light shades and dark shades. The colors are blended in very nicely and neatly.
    * From BS: Hey Frank, You really have a distinct style and quality to your work. I like how vibrant you made the lighter parts of the skin, which contrast really nicely with that sort of purple mixture you used for the darker parts. I like how you blended everything, but it still looks like there are strokes going in all kinds of directions. You captured the little hairs quite well too. The only suggestion I would make is that the eyes look kinda hollow. Maybe if you suggested the eyeballs a tiny bit, it would look more like the photo. Really good job, keep up the good worküëç
* **Exercise 4-Value Memory as Layered Imagery**
  * **Materials:** Bristol paper (or water color paper, mixed media paper, board, etc.) taped picture plane, full page of 11X14''
  * **Media:** open medium. Must include at least 3 layers of the following Please include a brief description of your work. You do not have to describe the memory if it's personal and you prefer not to. I do not want to make you feel uncomfortable but you can let the viewer know what emotions you aimed to express.
  * **Using a minimum of three different layering techniques demonstrated**:
    * dripping
    * splatter
    * stenciling
    * collaging with cut-outs, photo, thread, map, sticker, etc. 
    * hand-made marks
    * image transferring
  * Create a drawing that contains a minimum of three different layers that cross over each other at least 3 times, and communicates ideas associated with the concept of memory in some way or larger issues that can be related to memory. 
  * The act of remembering is one of recalling previous experiences, of retaining and reviving impressions from the past. While these impressions are housed in the past, the act of remembering always occurs in the present as a reconstruction of the past. Because of this, memories are fluid things; perceptions that have a tendency to slip, blur, overlap or change over time as new experiences alter base perceptions. Personal memories are subjective, being created from highly individualistic viewpoints. People who experience the same event at the same time, may come away from that event with differing memories.
  * Memories may be attached to somatic responses and sometimes possess a tangible quality. For example, memory has been known to trigger strong smells, emotions, and sounds. Using layering as a strategy in making imagery can be used to communicate ideas associated with memory, time and experience and emotion from the memory.
  * The layers can be physical layers, as in adhering collaged elements, and/or drawn layers of imagery, or any combination of these. However, this layered image drawing must consist of at least 50% hand-made marks as opposed to collage, transfers, etc. NO SKETCHES. NOT THUMBNAILS. Work intuitively.
  * To get a good grade, the work must go beyond a literal depiction of personal memories. Avoid clich√© literal depiction of the actual event. Avoid decorative photo album approach. Think about the emotions and fragments from that event/memory. Engage with your internal thoughts and feelings in the process.

* **Exercise 5-Value Spheres with Graphite & Colored Pencil**
  * **Materials:** paint on Bristol
  * Watch the demos BEFORE STARTING. Pay attention to the portion of paint when you mix colors. For example, when we mix green, we use very little blue but a lot of yellow
  * Paint 12 colors on your color wheel following the diagram: 3 primary colors, 3 secondary colors and 6 tertiary colors. Label all the colors correctly on your color wheel.
  * Add tints and shades in color wheel
  * Paint a chart of mixing 1 pair of complementary 
  * Paint a value scale of a warm color OR a cool color
  * Extra credit : add a value scale of a color of the other temperature; mix and paint 1 cool brown and 1 warm brown
  * For students who have taken ARTS 12-Design & Color, and have painted a color wheel before, you can submit the color wheel that you completed in that class but make sure you include the chart of mixing complementary colors
  * Making comments in discussions takes up 5% of your grades. If you see many comments of one post, please move onto posts that have 0 or 1 comment

* **Extra Credit** (3) Make an extra collage for Exercise 4 and turn it into a series using the same materials (2pts) 
  * [Work](https://photos.app.goo.gl/FHzpfrbdkL4W3PAU6)
* **Assignment 4-Gouache Paint Thumbnails**
  * Think about composition, picture plane orientation, location of words and color scheme
  * I cut out several thing from magazine and developed four set of thumbnails.
  * Idea 1- Lips Flowers for "ME2": The first one is based on the composition of a photo of a flower painting. But instead of paint flower, I will paint red female lips in different kind of red as the flowers. The background will be in skin color and  I cut out many female red lips for my "prototype" I also find several lipstick color from magazine for reference. This poster will be in landscape. On the upper right corner, I plan to collage a three letter M E 2 vertically to make this poster a MeToo movement reminder to encourage victims of sexual harassment to speak up. I like this design a lot. I need more detail design on the number, shape, size, color, angles, and placement of the lips.
  * Idea 2- Mushroom, Zoom in as Georgia O'Keeffe
The second set is based on a photo of mushroom. For my painting, I plan to make them in portrait mode and only pain 3-4 different mush room zoom in , larger and overlapping each other. Or maybe I should take the Georgia O'Keeffe approach to zoom in only one mushroom. The color tone will be dark purple, dark brown, dark orange, maybe yellow, if I paint that particular yellow mushroom.
  * Idea 3- Lamb: The third idea is to paint the head of a lamb. I do not like this idea that much. But I never paint lamb and could be fund to do create an abstract one. 
  * Idea 4- Blue and Red - Mixing Elements from red/blue Highheel, Bowl, Hat 
The final set is based on 3 photos- a red hat, a Dior burgundy blue transparent heel designer high heel, and a blue color glassbowl. I think I can combine some elements from these three photo togeter: For example, apply the pattern on the blow to the highheel, apply the color and pattern on the highheel to the bowl, or paint both the hat and the highheel but adopt the highheel pattern to the hat. But I am not sure what message should I attache with this.
  * **Feedback From Cindi Widl**
    * Idea 1- Lips Flowers for "ME2": I like the color palette for this idea as well as the message behind it. The repetition makes it visually interesting. I'm just wondering how you would go about executing the stems. 
    * Idea 2- Mushroom, Zoom in as Georgia O'Keeffe: I think this would be my favorite idea. The differences in scale and the overlapping would make for a strong piece. I also think the colors you've chosen would suit it. 
    * Idea 3- Lamb: This idea could be cool but if you don't like it, I think it's better to go with something else. 
    * Idea 4- Blue and Red - Mixing Elements from red/blue Highheel, Bowl, Hat: I like the concept of this idea with the red and blue mixture. I like the composition of this piece since its fills up the space but also leaves room for text on the side. It's a good idea but the blue/red painting might be a little challenging. 
* **Assignment 4-Gouache Paint**
  * **MATERIALS:** Bristol paper, graphite pencil, ruler, tape, magazine, glue, gouache paint (or acrylic paint), brushes and palette
  * **SIZE:** Taped picture plane of 10X12‚Äô‚Äô (no smaller than 10‚Äô‚Äô)
  * Students create a gouache illustration with collaged cut-out words inspired by an object(s) chosen from magazines. Consider the illustration a poster/advertisement for this product or your extended ideas inspired by the object(s) that you chose. NO HUMAN FIGURES unless students are confident regarding anatomy. The product can be an imaginary item from an orange (product can be a beverage), a shoe (product can be your own shoe brand), a handbag (product can be your own fashion brand), a flower (product can be a body oil or lotion), etc. DO NOT COPY AN EXISTING AD. Student who copy an existing ad will receive a failing grade.
  * **STEPS:**
    * Find an object(s) from magazine pages (high quality images).
    * Sketch out thumbnails for your ideas and post in discussion (orientation of picture plane-vertical/horizontal/square, composition, arrangement of words). Think about a color scheme that can go well with your design. Pay attention to adjusting hue, value and saturation and using neutrals to create a visually pleasing design. Paint at least 4-5 swatches of the key colors that you plan on using in the design.
    * Sketch out lightly with graphite pencil on Bristol and pay attention to shapes for highlights and shadows. Tape around your picture plane. Apply gouache paint evenly. Start from general to specific. Paint big shapes then small shapes. One shape at a time. Each shape should be painted flat and even. NO GRADATION WITHIN ONE SHAPE. 
    * Paint the whole picture plane. Do not leave background blank.
    * When painting is dry, glue cut-out words from magazines. Content of text can be ambiguous. Consider different effects of font, size and arrangement. Try different arrangements before gluing.

* **Final Project**
  * **Materials:** Open Medium: Micron ink pen, ink & brush, charcoal, graphite, Conte, colored pencil, chalk pastel, gouache paint, collage, stencil, transfer and any layering techniques. Students who use mixed media will be given extra credit. Charcoal & graphite are too similar and will not be considered mixed media when used in an artwork.
  * **Size:** whole sheet of Bristol/Strathmore paper. Tape edges if needed
  * For our final assignment, students are asked to create a surrealistic drawing inspired by everyday object(s) around us. Utilize the strategies introduced in class. Consider the following when developing thumbnails:
    * What strategy(ies) should you use to execute the idea?
    * What composition will make this drawing more effective? (viewing angle, cropping, rule of 3rd)

    * What about the background? What do you need to add to make your idea more visually interesting? (foreground, middle ground, background)

    * Where is your focal point? What should you do to make it stand out? (value contrast, warm/cook color, amount of details, etc.)

    * What about lighting? Will adding cast shadows help?

    * The final drawing must consist at least 60% hand drawing (marks made by the hand as opposed to collage, transfer, etc.). To make a convincing drawing, you are encouraged to use visual references. For example, feel free to use photographs of clouds if you need to add them in the background.
