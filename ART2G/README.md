Hi everyone! My name is Frank Yung-Fong Tang or you can just call me Frank. My Chinese name is 譚永鋒. I intend to double major in Studio Art and Art History. I like to cook, paint, and study the Bible in my free time. I am going to Turkey to see a lot of Greek, Roman, Christian, and Islamic art May 10-24 this year with my church group and I am very excited about that. I waited for this course for many years and finally had the chance to take it. You can see most of my artworks from hereLinks to an external site..  I took a lot of photos when I visited museums and you can find them hereLinks to an external site.. In the past few years, I took a total of 439 photosLinks to an external site. of Islamic artworks - mostly from National Museum of Asian Art / Freer Gallery of Art in Washington DC and The MET in New York City. I really love the design of the window panels in Islamic art and their use of blue color. 
### Feedback
Welcome Frank, Thank you for sharing these photos!  I rely on the content produced by the MET for some of our lecture material. They have an incredible collection of Islamic art and a wonderful open educational platform. I hope you enjoy the class!

### Prompt
What aspects of the historical context in which Islam emerges help us to better understand the cultural and ideological collisions and collusions that were at play when Islam emerged and still echo in geopolitical tensions today?
### Submission
The most significant geopolitical tension today is no doubt the conflict between Israel and Islamic nations (Qolbi and Sidqi). The historical context in which Islam emerges helps us to better understand why the Dome of the Rock was built in Jerusalem and why that structure is that important for Islamic countries (Rabbat). It also helps us to understand why Jerusalem is important to Muslim (Mourad). The understanding of the early conflicts between the Byzantine Empire and the Islamic world also help us to understand why many western countries today support Israel. The knowledge about the differences between Shi’a and Sunnis helps us to understand the tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran and conflicts between different Islam countries and some major causes of the Syrian civil war (Rizki). The culture in the Western World today is largely influenced by Greek Hellenism adopted by Romans (Heit). Somehow the identification of Christian culture influenced many western countries to support the Israeli government to suppress Palestinian and loop western countries into the conflict between Israel and Islamic nations. The Iran-Iraq war in the 1980 (Karsh), the aftermath of the US-led Iraq invasion (Machlis), the raising of ISIS (Hawley), the Syrian Civil War (Manan and Taran), the Yemeni Civil War (Manea), and the Iran-Saudi Arabia conflict (al-Rasheed) are all modern day examples showing the conflict between Shi’a and Sunnis Muslim. 

        On the other hand, the early intermix between Muslim, Jewish and Christian help us to understand why Muslim and Christian currently live rather peacefully together in Malaysia (Latif) and Indonesia (Manik and Nugroho), unlike what is happening in the Middle East right now. Historically, Muslim were friendly to Jewish and Christian for centuries until politicians used radical voices for their personal gain of powers (Sirgy et al).

        These historical contexts in which Islam emerges also help us to understand why early Islam behaved very differently as a lot of western media portray they are in the modern world. They were friendly to Jew and Christian in the 6th and 7th century because they see themself as an extension of Jewish and Chrisitan belief and considered local Jew and Christian as a group of potential people to convert into their faith. Because of that, when Islam ruled over Istanbul, they didn’t destroy Christian churches such as Hagia Sophia, The Church of the Holy Apostles, The Church of the Pantocrator (which became Zeyrek Mosque),  The Church of SS Sergius and Bacchus (which became Little Hagia Sophia mosque), and The Church of Saint Andrew in Krisei (which became Koca Mustafa Pasha Mosque). They repurpose those meeting places and respectfully covered Christian artworks with plaster, instead of demolishing them (Hartmuth).

This is a great deal of research. I am not going to discourage it but please know the weekly discussion prompts are geared toward the content for the week. This is important for equitable grading. Discussions are low stake assignments. 

Jews, Christians, and Muslims have lived in close proximity in many many contexts. 

## Comments to classmates
### Dear Abigail:

Thanks for your post. I agree with you that "The complex historical culture and context dating from the 7th to the 21st century influenced geopolitical tensions today". However, I think the assignment is asking us to explict mention which aspects of such tension could be better understand by studying them. I think your essay would be stronger if you explicitly provide one or two concrete examples. I am not sure about your mention of calligraphy. How is that collisions and/or collusions that is still echo in geopolitical tensions today? I would to read your elaboration on that. 

Regards,

Frank

### Dear Jinjingyi:

Thank you for your great essay. You made a great point about that the geographical placement has a significant impact. I agree that Arabian society was not isolated and was a part of broader regional dynamics. This is a great insight. I think the "multifarious cross-pollinations" idea you mentioned is very interesting. In a sense, the people in the Middle East today is not just Muslim but also inherited from tribal Arabic culture. Therefore, we won't be easily distingish between the impact from the religion and the impact from their pre-existing tribal culture. I love your conclusion that "Culturally and religiously, the Arabian Peninsula was pluralistic". 

It is interesting that you discuss "the fall of great cities to Islam like Petra and Maleha came due to changing trade routes". I wonder how does the discovery and trade of oil in the last century impact the raising of Islam nations in the last fifty years.

Regards,

Frank

### Prompt
What impact did Islamic scholarship during the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad in the Middle Ages have on later development of Western thought (please provide three examples)? Please also post a peer comment.
### Submission
There are many impacts that influenced the later development of Western thought by Islamic scholarship during the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad in the Middle Ages. In the Abbasid Caliphate, encouraged by al-Rashid and al-Ma’mun, they translated a lot of text from Greek and gathered scholars from different cultural or even religions to collaborate together and therefore preserve a lot of ancient knowledge for the human kind (Gutas). Their desire for knowledge also helped them to acquire paper making technology from China and later spread to Europe (Hannawi). 

        One important area of contribution is mathematics. Persian mathematician Al-Khwarizmi invented a systematic approach to algebra (Soofi) and formalized how mathematics works (Rashed). He also introduced the Hindu-Arabic numeral system which later quickly adopted in the West(Mohamed). His contributions were foundational for the development of mathematics, technology, science, and commerce in the West. These helped to advance the intellectual development of the Renaissance (Elamin). 

        The second example is the development of trigonometry functions in the 10th century by Persian mathematician and astronomer Abu al-Wafa al-Buzjani (Berggren). His comprehensive and rigorous publication established trigonometric functions, identities, and spherical trigonometry systematically advanced the foundation for the field (Maigida). During the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the Latin translation of his works supplied Western scholars vital mathematical tools to improve the field of astronomy, navigation, physics, and engineering (Selin). His mathematical theory greatly impacted the Scientific Revolution in the 16th and 17th centuries and the subsequent development of Western thought (Hashemi).

        During  the 11th-12th centuries, Omar Khayyam significantly impacted later Western thought in his research and improvement in his systematic classification and solution of cubic equations (Mardia). His theory went beyond geometric solutions and outlined groundwork for the development of modern algebraic theory (Siadat and Tholen). His parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry work offered critical insights which later contributed to the final development of non-Euclidean geometries in the 19th century (Smilga). His work challenged several long-held assumptions and breakthroughs the horizons of mathematical thought in the West (Gangolli).

         The advancements in mathematics made by Al-Khwarizmi, Abu al-Wafa al-Buzjani, and Omar Khayyam are three examples best demonstrating the kind of impact Islamic scholarship accomplished during the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad in the Middle Ages later influenced the development of Western thought. There are many other examples in the field of translation, knowledge preservation, optical, geometric, artistic design (Zulfa and Mawardi), and medicine (Hemat and Hamid).

#### Dear Hiady:

I agree with you that the translation and preservation of Greek texts is a significant contribution of Islamic Scholar during the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad (Gutas; Kalin). Keskinbora published a systematic review of how "Canon of Medicine" written by Ibn Sina impact the education and development of western medicine (Keskinbora).

#### Dear Alexis

The knowledge about medicine during this period is significant. I went to National Museum of Asian Art / Freer Gallery of Art in Washington DC two years ago and took the following four photos. These three pages show us the details of drawing preserving the knowledge in those days.
