Hi everyone! My name is Frank Yung-Fong Tang or you can just call me Frank. My Chinese name is 譚永鋒. I intend to double major in Studio Art and Art History. I like to cook, paint, and study the Bible in my free time. I am going to Turkey to see a lot of Greek, Roman, Christian, and Islamic art May 10-24 this year with my church group and I am very excited about that. I waited for this course for many years and finally had the chance to take it. You can see most of my artworks from hereLinks to an external site..  I took a lot of photos when I visited museums and you can find them hereLinks to an external site.. In the past few years, I took a total of 439 photosLinks to an external site. of Islamic artworks - mostly from National Museum of Asian Art / Freer Gallery of Art in Washington DC and The MET in New York City. I really love the design of the window panels in Islamic art and their use of blue color.

### Prompt
What aspects of the historical context in which Islam emerges help us to better understand the cultural and ideological collisions and collusions that were at play when Islam emerged and still echo in geopolitical tensions today?
### Submission
The most significant geopolitical tension today is no doubt the conflict between Israel and Islamic nations (Qolbi and Sidqi). The historical context in which Islam emerges helps us to better understand why the Dome of the Rock was built in Jerusalem and why that structure is that important for Islamic countries (Rabbat). It also helps us to understand why Jerusalem is important to Muslim (Mourad). The understanding of the early conflicts between the Byzantine Empire and the Islamic world also help us to understand why many western countries today support Israel. The knowledge about the differences between Shi’a and Sunnis helps us to understand the tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran and conflicts between different Islam countries and some major causes of the Syrian civil war (Rizki). The culture in the Western World today is largely influenced by Greek Hellenism adopted by Romans (Heit). Somehow the identification of Christian culture influenced many western countries to support the Israeli government to suppress Palestinian and loop western countries into the conflict between Israel and Islamic nations. The Iran-Iraq war in the 1980 (Karsh), the aftermath of the US-led Iraq invasion (Machlis), the raising of ISIS (Hawley), the Syrian Civil War (Manan and Taran), the Yemeni Civil War (Manea), and the Iran-Saudi Arabia conflict (al-Rasheed) are all modern day examples showing the conflict between Shi’a and Sunnis Muslim. 

        On the other hand, the early intermix between Muslim, Jewish and Christian help us to understand why Muslim and Christian currently live rather peacefully together in Malaysia (Latif) and Indonesia (Manik and Nugroho), unlike what is happening in the Middle East right now. Historically, Muslim were friendly to Jewish and Christian for centuries until politicians used radical voices for their personal gain of powers (Sirgy et al).

        These historical contexts in which Islam emerges also help us to understand why early Islam behaved very differently as a lot of western media portray they are in the modern world. They were friendly to Jew and Christian in the 6th and 7th century because they see themself as an extension of Jewish and Chrisitan belief and considered local Jew and Christian as a group of potential people to convert into their faith. Because of that, when Islam ruled over Istanbul, they didn’t destroy Christian churches such as Hagia Sophia, The Church of the Holy Apostles, The Church of the Pantocrator (which became Zeyrek Mosque),  The Church of SS Sergius and Bacchus (which became Little Hagia Sophia mosque), and The Church of Saint Andrew in Krisei (which became Koca Mustafa Pasha Mosque). They repurpose those meeting places and respectfully covered Christian artworks with plaster, instead of demolishing them (Hartmuth).

This is a great deal of research. I am not going to discourage it but please know the weekly discussion prompts are geared toward the content for the week. This is important for equitable grading. Discussions are low stake assignments. 

Jews, Christians, and Muslims have lived in close proximity in many many contexts. 

## Comments to classmates
### Dear Abigail:

Thanks for your post. I agree with you that "The complex historical culture and context dating from the 7th to the 21st century influenced geopolitical tensions today". However, I think the assignment is asking us to explict mention which aspects of such tension could be better understand by studying them. I think your essay would be stronger if you explicitly provide one or two concrete examples. I am not sure about your mention of calligraphy. How is that collisions and/or collusions that is still echo in geopolitical tensions today? I would to read your elaboration on that. 

Regards,

Frank

### Dear Jinjingyi:

Thank you for your great essay. You made a great point about that the geographical placement has a significant impact. I agree that Arabian society was not isolated and was a part of broader regional dynamics. This is a great insight. I think the "multifarious cross-pollinations" idea you mentioned is very interesting. In a sense, the people in the Middle East today is not just Muslim but also inherited from tribal Arabic culture. Therefore, we won't be easily distingish between the impact from the religion and the impact from their pre-existing tribal culture. I love your conclusion that "Culturally and religiously, the Arabian Peninsula was pluralistic". 

It is interesting that you discuss "the fall of great cities to Islam like Petra and Maleha came due to changing trade routes". I wonder how does the discovery and trade of oil in the last century impact the raising of Islam nations in the last fifty years.

Regards,

Frank
