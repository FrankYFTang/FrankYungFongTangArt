Hi everyone! My name is Frank Yung-Fong Tang or you can just call me Frank. My Chinese name is 譚永鋒. I intend to double major in Studio Art and Art History. I like to cook, paint, and study the Bible in my free time. I am going to Turkey to see a lot of Greek, Roman, Christian, and Islamic art May 10-24 this year with my church group and I am very excited about that. I waited for this course for many years and finally had the chance to take it. You can see most of my artworks from hereLinks to an external site..  I took a lot of photos when I visited museums and you can find them hereLinks to an external site.. In the past few years, I took a total of 439 photosLinks to an external site. of Islamic artworks - mostly from National Museum of Asian Art / Freer Gallery of Art in Washington DC and The MET in New York City. I really love the design of the window panels in Islamic art and their use of blue color.

Welcome Frank, Thank you for sharing these photos!  I rely on the content produced by the MET for some of our lecture material. They have an incredible collection of Islamic art and a wonderful open educational platform. I hope you enjoy the class!
