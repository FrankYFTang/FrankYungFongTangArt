Hi everyone! My name is Frank Yung-Fong Tang or you can just call me Frank. My Chinese name is 譚永鋒. I intend to double major in Studio Art and Art History. I like to cook, paint, and study the Bible in my free time. I am going to Turkey to see a lot of Greek, Roman, Christian, and Islamic art May 10-24 this year with my church group and I am very excited about that. I waited for this course for many years and finally had the chance to take it. You can see most of my artworks from hereLinks to an external site..  I took a lot of photos when I visited museums and you can find them hereLinks to an external site.. In the past few years, I took a total of 439 photosLinks to an external site. of Islamic artworks - mostly from National Museum of Asian Art / Freer Gallery of Art in Washington DC and The MET in New York City. I really love the design of the window panels in Islamic art and their use of blue color. 
### Feedback
Welcome Frank, Thank you for sharing these photos!  I rely on the content produced by the MET for some of our lecture material. They have an incredible collection of Islamic art and a wonderful open educational platform. I hope you enjoy the class!

### Prompt
What aspects of the historical context in which Islam emerges help us to better understand the cultural and ideological collisions and collusions that were at play when Islam emerged and still echo in geopolitical tensions today?
### Submission
The most significant geopolitical tension today is no doubt the conflict between Israel and Islamic nations (Qolbi and Sidqi). The historical context in which Islam emerges helps us to better understand why the Dome of the Rock was built in Jerusalem and why that structure is that important for Islamic countries (Rabbat). It also helps us to understand why Jerusalem is important to Muslim (Mourad). The understanding of the early conflicts between the Byzantine Empire and the Islamic world also help us to understand why many western countries today support Israel. The knowledge about the differences between Shi’a and Sunnis helps us to understand the tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran and conflicts between different Islam countries and some major causes of the Syrian civil war (Rizki). The culture in the Western World today is largely influenced by Greek Hellenism adopted by Romans (Heit). Somehow the identification of Christian culture influenced many western countries to support the Israeli government to suppress Palestinian and loop western countries into the conflict between Israel and Islamic nations. The Iran-Iraq war in the 1980 (Karsh), the aftermath of the US-led Iraq invasion (Machlis), the raising of ISIS (Hawley), the Syrian Civil War (Manan and Taran), the Yemeni Civil War (Manea), and the Iran-Saudi Arabia conflict (al-Rasheed) are all modern day examples showing the conflict between Shi’a and Sunnis Muslim. 

        On the other hand, the early intermix between Muslim, Jewish and Christian help us to understand why Muslim and Christian currently live rather peacefully together in Malaysia (Latif) and Indonesia (Manik and Nugroho), unlike what is happening in the Middle East right now. Historically, Muslim were friendly to Jewish and Christian for centuries until politicians used radical voices for their personal gain of powers (Sirgy et al).

        These historical contexts in which Islam emerges also help us to understand why early Islam behaved very differently as a lot of western media portray they are in the modern world. They were friendly to Jew and Christian in the 6th and 7th century because they see themself as an extension of Jewish and Chrisitan belief and considered local Jew and Christian as a group of potential people to convert into their faith. Because of that, when Islam ruled over Istanbul, they didn’t destroy Christian churches such as Hagia Sophia, The Church of the Holy Apostles, The Church of the Pantocrator (which became Zeyrek Mosque),  The Church of SS Sergius and Bacchus (which became Little Hagia Sophia mosque), and The Church of Saint Andrew in Krisei (which became Koca Mustafa Pasha Mosque). They repurpose those meeting places and respectfully covered Christian artworks with plaster, instead of demolishing them (Hartmuth).

### Comments to classmates
#### Dear Abigail:

Thanks for your post. I agree with you that "The complex historical culture and context dating from the 7th to the 21st century influenced geopolitical tensions today". However, I think the assignment is asking us to explict mention which aspects of such tension could be better understand by studying them. I think your essay would be stronger if you explicitly provide one or two concrete examples. I am not sure about your mention of calligraphy. How is that collisions and/or collusions that is still echo in geopolitical tensions today? I would to read your elaboration on that. 

Regards,

Frank

#### Dear Jinjingyi:

Thank you for your great essay. You made a great point about that the geographical placement has a significant impact. I agree that Arabian society was not isolated and was a part of broader regional dynamics. This is a great insight. I think the "multifarious cross-pollinations" idea you mentioned is very interesting. In a sense, the people in the Middle East today is not just Muslim but also inherited from tribal Arabic culture. Therefore, we won't be easily distingish between the impact from the religion and the impact from their pre-existing tribal culture. I love your conclusion that "Culturally and religiously, the Arabian Peninsula was pluralistic". 

It is interesting that you discuss "the fall of great cities to Islam like Petra and Maleha came due to changing trade routes". I wonder how does the discovery and trade of oil in the last century impact the raising of Islam nations in the last fifty years.

Regards,

Frank

### Prompt
What impact did Islamic scholarship during the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad in the Middle Ages have on later development of Western thought (please provide three examples)? Please also post a peer comment.
### Submission
There are many impacts that influenced the later development of Western thought by Islamic scholarship during the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad in the Middle Ages. In the Abbasid Caliphate, encouraged by al-Rashid and al-Ma’mun, they translated a lot of text from Greek and gathered scholars from different cultural or even religions to collaborate together and therefore preserve a lot of ancient knowledge for the human kind (Gutas). Their desire for knowledge also helped them to acquire paper making technology from China and later spread to Europe (Hannawi). 

        One important area of contribution is mathematics. Persian mathematician Al-Khwarizmi invented a systematic approach to algebra (Soofi) and formalized how mathematics works (Rashed). He also introduced the Hindu-Arabic numeral system which later quickly adopted in the West(Mohamed). His contributions were foundational for the development of mathematics, technology, science, and commerce in the West. These helped to advance the intellectual development of the Renaissance (Elamin). 

        The second example is the development of trigonometry functions in the 10th century by Persian mathematician and astronomer Abu al-Wafa al-Buzjani (Berggren). His comprehensive and rigorous publication established trigonometric functions, identities, and spherical trigonometry systematically advanced the foundation for the field (Maigida). During the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the Latin translation of his works supplied Western scholars vital mathematical tools to improve the field of astronomy, navigation, physics, and engineering (Selin). His mathematical theory greatly impacted the Scientific Revolution in the 16th and 17th centuries and the subsequent development of Western thought (Hashemi).

        During  the 11th-12th centuries, Omar Khayyam significantly impacted later Western thought in his research and improvement in his systematic classification and solution of cubic equations (Mardia). His theory went beyond geometric solutions and outlined groundwork for the development of modern algebraic theory (Siadat and Tholen). His parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry work offered critical insights which later contributed to the final development of non-Euclidean geometries in the 19th century (Smilga). His work challenged several long-held assumptions and breakthroughs the horizons of mathematical thought in the West (Gangolli).

         The advancements in mathematics made by Al-Khwarizmi, Abu al-Wafa al-Buzjani, and Omar Khayyam are three examples best demonstrating the kind of impact Islamic scholarship accomplished during the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad in the Middle Ages later influenced the development of Western thought. There are many other examples in the field of translation, knowledge preservation, optical, geometric, artistic design (Zulfa and Mawardi), and medicine (Hemat and Hamid).

#### Dear Hiady:

I agree with you that the translation and preservation of Greek texts is a significant contribution of Islamic Scholar during the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad (Gutas; Kalin). Keskinbora published a systematic review of how "Canon of Medicine" written by Ibn Sina impact the education and development of western medicine (Keskinbora).

This week we learned about Islamic art's eclecticism (the practice of deriving ideas, style, or taste from a broad and diverse range of sources) and embrace of other cultures. 

For this weeks discussion please discuss one example from this weeks content where we see a blending of aesthetic styles, materials and inspiration from other cultures in an Islamic artistic expression in art or architecture. Please also post a peer response. 
### Submission
 Both Blue Qur'an and the al-ʿAziz ewer are examples of Islamic artworks mixed with aesthetic styles, materials and inspiration from other cultures. 

     The folio from the "Blue Qur'an" demonstrates a mixing of aesthetic styles, material, and inspiration from the cultures in Christian Byzantine Empire. While they are not sure the exact dating, location of origin, and patronage of the Blue Qur'an, historians believe it was produced in the late 9th to mid-10th century in either Qairawan, Tunisia or Cordoba in Umayyad Spain. It is written in Kufic script but with a very unique medium on a very unique material and writing style. Usually Qur'an manuscripts are written against a white ground in brown or black ink with red voweling and diacritical marks. But Blue Qur'an is not! The calligraphy was written in gold and silver on a rare indigo-dyed parchment. This manner is similar to official documents and manuscripts from the Christian Byzantine Empire. For example, “the marriage contract of the princess Theophanou, who was dispatched from Constantinnople in 970 to marry the German emperor, was drawn up in gold lettering on purple-tinted vellum” (Hillenbrand, 71). This Islamic artistic expression clearly shows a blending of Isalamic art form with their Christian Byzantine Empire neighbor (Ekhtiar et al., 59).

     Another example of Islamic artwork displaying such blending is the rock crystal al-ʿAziz ewer currently displayed in the Treasury of San Marco. First, the raw rock crystal material of this artwork, an “exceptionally large and clear crystal of pure quartz”, is likely originally mined in Madagascar (Fein). Second, the theme of the animal drinking from the ewer, represented by the ibex perched by the rim, is “rooted in pre-islamic religious rituals and common in metalwork” (Hillenbrand, 88). The inscription on the neck of the ewer, “blessing from Allah for the imam al-ʿAziz Biʾllah”, is in Arabic typography to denote its patron, Fatimid caliph al-ʿAziz Biʾllah. Finally, the artistic process to make this wonderful vessel employed wheel-cut carving technique, which demonstrates Egyptian craftsmanship (89). This amazing crystal rock ewer shows us a mixed spinning of pre-islamic religious aesthetic theme, Madagascar materials and Egyptian craftsmanship in an Islamic artwork.

     From the three course materials cited in this essay, we better understand how surrounding culture influenced the aesthetic styles and use of materials in Islamic artwork and how their artists were invigorated by other cultures.

#### Dear Ares:

I took about 3,600 photos ( https://photos.app.goo.gl/M8YnV9o1QNfrGTUL8Links to an external site.  ) when I visted the Metropolitan Museum of Art in May 2023. That probably only cover a quarter of the space I can visit. I only visited there for three days at that trip. For the Islamic art exhibited in the MET, I took about 250 photos. You can see all the 439 photos about Islamic arts I took inside National Museum of Asian Art / Freer Gallery of Art, DC and Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City from the following link: https://photos.app.goo.gl/aEuVif5JqJ3efiQw6Links to an external site. 

#### Dear Ares

This discussion assignment requests us to discuss artwork which shows “a blending of aesthetic styles, materials and inspiration from other cultures in an Islamic artistic expression”.  Your post shows a very detailed description of the style, and subjects on this beautiful Islamic artistic expression. I believe your essay would be greatly improved if you add more analysis about where you observe the culture blending from it. The mention of San Marco in Venice is only about its current owner and where we could see this artworks but not related to the blending displayed on the ewr. From my point of view, this ewr shows the blending from four aspects- material, theme, the writing system of the text, and the production technique. We know the material is likely from Madagascar. According to Hillenbrand, the ibex perched by the rim, is “rooted in pre-islamic religious rituals and common in metalwork” (Hillenbrand, 88). The writing system of the text on the neck is Arabic. Finally, the production technique is Cairo craftsmanship in Egypt. We see the bleeding of these four cultural influences on this work.

#### Dear Jinjingyi:

Cappella Palatina is surely a place where we observe “blending of aesthetic styles, materials and inspiration from other cultures in an Islamic architecture”. In addition to the Islamic muqarnas, Romanesque layout, and Byzantine theme and artistic style on mosaic, I would like to add one additional element I observed from the photos of culture blending- the capitals of columns inside Cappella Palatina are in Corinthian order, showing a Greek influence.

How is the fivefold or ten-pointed stars pattern used in Islamic geometric design in Islamic art? What are the challenges of their usage?

How can your guiding question be rephrased as a thesis?
Fivefold or ten-pointed stars pattern design in Islamic art is important and significant although the usage of such usage carries more design challenges than other pointed stars.

What is going well in your paper?
I found three great examples of fivefold and ten-pointed stars of Islamic art from the photos I took in the The Metropolitan Museum of Art two years ago as my research example. These photos in detail are very helpful. I purchased four books and downloaded some good papers to read so far. All are relevant and provide different perspectives of the topic. I also found several very good books and papers about this topic for the research. So far these materials provide enough information for the research. 

What are the challenges in your paper?
There are many things I like to cover in this research paper and I need to limit the scope. 
### Feedback
The thesis is good. You use the word usage twice in one sentence. Consider saying it once. You might also consider being specific about the significance. The challenges of other pointed stars might be part of the overall introduction.

What were the positive and negative impacts of the Safavid dynasty establishing Shi'a Islam as the state religion? In your response please consider political and artistic/cultural consequences and the role it played in shaping a national identity?
### Submission
By establishing Shi'a Islam as the state religion, the Safavid dynasty created some positive and negative impacts. From the positive view, this act strengthened state and forged national identity, encouraged pilgrimages and cultural exchange, and also influenced and enriched artistic and architectural styles. However, it also increased the conflict with Sunni neighbors, created potential for religious persecution and intolerance, and shifted the artistic patronage focus from Sufism.

        After making Shi'ism as the state religion, the Safavid dynasty made a strong ideology to unified the disparate regions of Iran into a single Safavid rule. This differentiated the Safavid Empire from the Ottomans and Shaibanids, both followed Sunni teaching. Because of that, it helped Iran avoid absorption into their control and created a unique Persian national identity (Brown-Hejazi). Their strong investment in architecture and decorating shrines of Shi'a saints around two central Iran cities, Karbala and Najaf, encouraged pilgrimages across the empire and therefore amplified cultural exchange. These travels strengthened the cultural and religious unity across the massive Safavid dynasty (Brown-Hejazi). The embracement of Shi'a Islam affected the Safavid architecture and art style. Such influence is very obvious in the decoration of Shi'a shrines. The unified state centralized power and produced extensive wealth for a massive amount of art patronage to create Islamic art. The result is a huge amount of painted manuscripts, elegant textiles, such as the Ardabil Carpet , and giant architecture decorated with new "haft-rangi" tiles and "aineh-kari" mirror work (Macaulay). The collection of these artworks built a agglutinate visual identity that lasted into later dynasties. These impacts lifted the artistic achievement of the Safavid dynasty to represent the Muslim aesthetic in Western view for a long period of time in the late 19th and early 20th century  (Macaulay).  

        However, the cost of establishing a state religion is huge and comes with some notable negative impacts also. First, this caused the Safavid empire to have more conflicts with their surrounding Sunni Neighbors. Both the Ottoman on their west and Shaibanids on their east are Sunni Muslim (Brown-Hejazi). The religious distinction fostered endless tensions and conflicts during the sixteenth century and created a lot of issues for the Safavid empire. By establishing an official state religion, they also increased the potential for religious persecution and intolerance of other Muslim teaching or religions. Finally, this could shift the artistic patronage focus away from Sufism. Because the Safavids were descendants of Sufi shaikhs who were greatly influenced by Sufism cultural and artistic before the establishment of Shi'a Islam as their state religion, such acts may reduce and limit their Sufism cultural and artistic expression. The cultural cost of establishing a state religion in the Safavid dynasty influenced a lot of modern day international tension in the Middle East. 

        The establishment of  Shi'a Islam as the state religion of the Safavid dynasty is fruitful but also costly at the same time. While it built a stronger national identity,increased cultural exchanges and economy from transportation and tourism, and enriched artistic and architectural styles, it also created everlasting tension and potential of conflicts with their Sunni neighbors for Iran. Studying their impacts help us to understand the dynamic and complexity of international tension in the contemporary Middle East better.

#### Dear Jinjingyi:

I wonder what differences it will be about the quality of their carpet attributed from their establishemnt of Shi’a Islam. In other words, if they do not declare Shi’a Islam as their state relgion would they also produce nice artwork such as Ardabil carpet, or it will be preoduce in the same quality regardless. I asked this because two weeks ago I went to Turkey and tour around a carpet factory and they also show me very nice carpet. And these carpet were produced under the culture of Ottoman empire, which is Sunni Islam. So I have difficulty to complete attribute the creation of their art are due to such establishment of state religion. I am not sure there are a linkj between these two thing. And it may be a non-unique consequence based on omitted condition.

What work of art, architectural structure or concept from this weeks content was most interesting to you and why? Please also post a peer comment. 
### Submission
Blue Mosque

        The most interesting art, architectural structure or concept from the content of this week is surely Blue Mosque for a simple reason- I visited it on May 12, 2025 during my Turkey trip. I know the teacher asked us to write based on the content of the week but it is just too hard for me to “forget” what I saw three weeks ago while I write this essay. Please forgive me for including what I personally see there, although this information is not mentioned in the week module.

        The official name of Blue Mosque is Sultan Ahmet Mosque. It was patronized by Sultan Ahmet I and completed in CE 1617. It was built southwest of Hagia Sophia, which was completed more than one thousand years prior. It is adjacent to the Byzantine Hippodrome and visitors enter from that. Clearly it was built to “compete” toward Hagia Sophia by the choice of location (Fig 1 & 2). It has six pencil-shaped minarets. The northwest side next to the Byzantine Hippodrome is the courtyard, with a central entrance which currently only allows exit from the courtyard (Fig 3 & 4). The central entrance to the courtyard is very beautiful and decorated with a muqarnas semi-vault and inscription panels on top and below the muqarnas (Fig 5 & 6). Visitors cannot enter that central entrance but instead turn right toward the side entrance to the dome and prayer hall on the southwest side of the mosque. Along the southwest wall there are a series of water taps with marble seats served as ablutions (Fig 7 & 8). Several people took out their shoes and washed their feet there before entering the mosque. All the visitors need to have cloth to cover their shoulder and knee and females need to cover their head with a scarf or head covering. Visitors need to remove their shoes and carry them before setting foot into the hallway of the mosque. The exterior hallway is supported by arches with alternating blocks of color and their ceilings are decorated by arabesque pattern (Fig 9 & 10). The wood doors are decorated by Islamic geometric tenfold star patterns (Fig 11 & 12). Enter the prayer hall, all the grounds are covered by red carpet and no visitors should place their shoes on the ground. Instead, they should either hold their shoes or place them on the provided shoes shelf on the side. The dome is magnificent, floating on top of 32 small stained glass windows (Fig 13). The center part of the dome is a big circle in a dark blue background with calligraphy in gold text and some dark red. A thick ring of 16 pillars is drawn between the stained glass windows and the center circle. Arabesque patterns in red, blue and white filled these shapes. The dome is set on top of four huge “elephant legs”, the term the tour jokingly called the large supporting pillars, with the assistance of four large half domes. Each large half dome has 13 stained glass windows and sit on top of three smaller half domes. Each smaller half dome has 5 stained glass windows. Therefore, there are a total of 12 small half domes (Fig 14-16). Muqarnas semi-vault are built below the 12 half domes (Fig 17). There are several wire lamp rings hung from the ceiling. Each lamp ring has many lamps attached but also some opaque white balls. These opaque white balls are Ostrich Eggs which are used as repellent against spiders or other insects. The upper part of the large pillars are decorated by blue and green vegetation patterns.  The lower parts are flueted and a ring of calligraphy separates these sections (Fig 18). The front of the mosque is roped and reserved for Muslim believers to enter to pray. There is a Hünkâr Mahfili, a white platform elevating near the front right pillar  reserved for the Sultan to pray. The Mihrab is in a similar style as the central entrance of the mosque, with a golden muqarnas semi-vault and two inscription panels on top of it (Fig 20). A very tall and narrow and pointed Minbar is right next to the Mihrab with a pointed golden top. A Kürsü, a wood Chair for Scholar that resembles a small cabinet or lectern, is placed on the front left (Fig 21). The courtyard is in rectangle shape and surrounded by a hallway formed by 32 small domes (Fig 22). Wooden windows with geometric patterns decorate the hallway. A fountain is in the center of the courtyard (Fig 23-24). Before exiting from the center entrance, the ground is formed by marble with a sixfold star pattern (Fig 25).

Great choices and comments that demonstrate an attentive engagement with the content for this week. Lovely analysis. 

The Blue Mosque was covered so it is fine for you to share your direct experience. It adds so much to the learning experience of other students.

Gorgeous images! It is so interesting to see a carpet like painting on the ceiling. The use of stained glass is also very interesting. 

I just don't want students to skip the reading and module lecture and google their responses. This is a matter of equitable grading.

#### Dear Weiton

I encounter many similar one during my Turkey trip last month. None of them are pretty as this one but all carry very similar shape. The following are filmed inside "History & Arts Museum" located in 
T.C. Kültür ve Turizm Bakanlığı İzmir Tarih ve Sanat Müzesi/ Museum Of History And Art. You can find more photos I took of them at https://photos.app.goo.gl/L644HeSY4xs45RK58Links to an external site.

Mona Hatoum incorporates the shape of cheese grater in her artwork Grater Divide, 2002. Hatoum uses the wordplay of “Grater” in the title. The noun “greater” sounds similar to the adjective “greater”. So the name “Grater Divide” sound’s like “Greater Divide”. Therefore she uses a “greater” cheese “grater” to create this Greater Grater Divide. Notice cheese is a very important ingredient in Lebanese culture and cuisine. There are many different kinds of cheese, such as Baladi , Ackawi, Labneh, and Halloumi. Therefore cheese grater is a common kitchen ware in Lebanon and she use a “greater” one to symbolize the division of the people.

Hatoum also amalgamated the combination of hair and Keffieh into her work Keffieh, 1993-99. On the Keffieh, she employed the pattern of fishnet, seawaves and straight line as symbols. I disagree with the analysis of these symbols mentioned in the module content. I believe the fishnet symbolizes the nature that Palestinian were trapped in, the seawaves symbolize the turbulence they are experiencing, and the straight line symbolizes the division line and barricade Israel IDF set to confine Palestinian. Finally the use of hair symbolizes all the Palestinian are physically trapped into this sad situation with their body without freedom. I think the symbolic meaning of this work is much darker than the content text describes.

In her series, Harem, Lalla Essaydi rendered a different depiction of Harem than most of the exotic Harem painted by 18th century Orientalist painters. There is no nude body, but instead, inside the colorful and highly decorated Harem we see an elegant lady dress casually, gracefully, with a dress pattern in similar aesthetic style as the background, relaxingly enjoying her space. Essaydi incorporates the misrepresented location of Harem in many orientist works and “corrects” their mistake by reverting the view to an appropriate representation. The Harem symbolize the misinterpretation of who the Muslim females are, and the elegant decorative pattern, many are Islamic geometric patterns, symbolize the wisdom and technology of Islamic culture which are often overlooked by those orientalist painters.

Lovely analysis. I appreciate how engaged you are with the topic for this week.
### Comments to classmates
#### Dear Jinjingyi:

Lalla Essaydi is a female, so... it should be "her works" not "his works" :)


#### Dear Jinjingyi:
Thank you for sharing your observation of Haji Noor Deen’s Allah Akbar and your reflection.  

I have some doubt about your statement "He clearly draws a lot of his style from Chinese calligraphic traditions". The reason is when I view how he write his work in 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9dI4RyZQeALinks to an external site.

he is not using traditional Chinese brush but rather flat brush which not used in traditional Chinese calligraphic. He for sure got some more Chinese astethic influence than any other Arabic calligrapher but I think the influence from Chinese calligraphic traditions toward his work is very limited.

Regards,

Frank
