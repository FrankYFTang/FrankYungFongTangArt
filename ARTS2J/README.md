# ARTS 2J History of Art: Arts of Africa, Oceania and Native North America

I took ARTS 2J History of Art: Arts of Africa, Oceania and Native North America in De Anza College during Fall 2023 (September 25 - December 15, 2023). This repo archived my work for this course. My professor is Catie Anne Cadge-Moore.
* Midterm Project- ["Arts in Kingdoms of West & Central Africa"](Project1Proposal.pdf)
  * **Comments from Professor**: "Excellent work, Frank. So thorough in your presentation of your research and I love the additional videos throughout. I attended a Bamana textile demonstration in Mali. The mud cloth creation is fascinating to watch. Your photos are beautiful as always! Someone should hire you as a curator! A+"
