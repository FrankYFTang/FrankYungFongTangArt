# ARTS 2J History of Art: Arts of Africa, Oceania and Native North America

I took ARTS 2J History of Art: Arts of Africa, Oceania and Native North America in De Anza College during Fall 2023 (September 25 - December 15, 2023). This repo archived my work for this course. My professor was Catie Anne Cadge-Moore.
* Midterm Project- ["Arts in Kingdoms of West & Central Africa"](Project1Proposal.pdf)
  * **Comments from Professor**: "Excellent work, Frank. So thorough in your presentation of your research and I love the additional videos throughout. I attended a Bamana textile demonstration in Mali. The mud cloth creation is fascinating to watch. Your photos are beautiful as always! Someone should hire you as a curator! A+"
* Final Project-
  * **Comments from Professor**:
* Extra Credit Paper 1- [Alaska and Arctic Masks in The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York](ARTS%202J%20EC1AKMasks.pdf)
* Extra Credit Paper 2- [Animal Masks in National Museum of the American Indian, Washington DC](ARTS%202J%20EC2AnimalMasks.pdf)
  * **Comments from Professor**: "Excellent work, Frank. I personally love Yup'ik masks and what fun to spend hours at the Met doing a detailed study in observation. Yup'ik masks always seem like contemporary installation art or assemblage to me and yet they are so spiritual in subject too. And in your paper about the Smithsonian masks, I appreciate your subtle observations using a critical eye. Cherokee masks can be so expressive and, sadly, they are not often included in art exhibits outside of the American South. Rick Bartow is another favorite artist of mine. His sculptures have that expressive feel similar to the Yup'ik masks I find! Great job!"
