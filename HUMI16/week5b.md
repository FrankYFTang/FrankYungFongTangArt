### Through Statute of Limitation (2018), Chukes challenged the lack of Liberty for Black citizens

Statute of Limitation (Fig. 2-7), is a blue and black human size ceramic sculpture made by artist Chukes in 2018. I encountered this amazing work in the Triton Museum of Art, City of Santa Clara during the grand opening of the artist’s “Identity Theft and Beyond” solo exhibition (Fig. 1). The artist critiques the true state of “Liberty” currently many American citizens are experiencing inside our country by referencing the famous Statue of Liberty in New York City. The artist replaced the white female Roman goddess Libertas with the facial characteristics of a black female. She still wears a diadem with seven spikes on her head (Fig. 3-4), and a more puffy stola on her body. Her poses are the same. Her right hand does not hold a torch but instead holding together and showing the gesture of a Raised Fist (Fig. 2, 3, 7). Her left hand still holds a tabula ansata. There are five lines of text on the surface, showing “Your History is only As good As the Truth” (Fig. 6). Her left hand not only holds the tabula ansata but also a chain behind it (Fig. 5). The skin portion of her head, and two hands are black while other parts are all in blue. It strongly challenges the concept of Liberty in our modern world and questions whether our African American neighbors also enjoy the same level of liberty as our white citizens live. The message is clear! The fullness of liberty in this country, until now, is only reserved for a selected race and not experienced by the Black citizens. Their history told us they still do not enjoy the land of liberty as what our country was established for. The artist skillfully combines well known symbolic figures to a realistic rendering of African American female figures to critique the social reality in our country. This work asks viewers to take the same stand as the artist to support the necessary changes in our country, by showing the gesture of holding the Raised Fist. I therefore stand next to it and also show the Raised Fist to express my support for the limitless liberty of our Black citizens. In the end, I had the privilege to talk to the artist Chukes and have a photo with him (Fig. 1).

## Feedback:
Thanks for sharing your example!

The practice of conveying social messages through images has a long history but really came into favor through the use of photography. During the twentieth century, social reformers discovered photography to be an effective means of influencing viewers. When we consider the impact of social and visual media today, the power of images has only increased. 

I think I was most struck by the depiction of Lady Liberty holding the fragment of chain in her hand, especially with it beneath the proclamation of freedom which she carries. This is a beautiful example of a turnaround, or framing of a familiar visual concept in a way that gives it a layering of empowerment. As is usual, I also enjoy your active participation in the art experience. Viewing art is so much more than just looking with our eyes, and I really have an appreciation for how much you engage with the display and the audience and the artist when they are available.
