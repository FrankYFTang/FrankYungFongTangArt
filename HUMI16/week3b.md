# Week 3 Explore Valuation in Art
## Instruction

The Task:

1. Select an art object with documented valuation (this may be a sales price or auction point) and identify the materials used to create the object, the title, and the artist. Discuss how the artist made an object of much greater value than the inherent worth of the raw materials – explain what factors, other than the creation process, might lead people to value it highly. (20 points)
1. Your post should be a minimum of 250+ words and you should cite resources used. (5 points)
1. Leave substantive* comments on THREE (3) other student posts – select ones who wrote about different songs than you selected. Use this as an opportunity to learn what they have to share. Each comment should be a minimum of 75+ words. (5 points each)

### ‘Insel Im Attersee’ (1901-2), Gustav Klimt sold for 53.2 million dollar

I visited Sotheby’s New York City in the morning of May 16, 2023. One piece that caught my eyes is a beautiful green landscape oil on canvas painting, ‘Insel Im Attersee’, by Austrian symbolist painter Gustav Klimt, executed circa 1901-02 (Fig. 1-2). The painting is in a unique size of 39 ½ by 39 ½ in. Klimt painted it during the summer on Lake Attersee (“Insel Im Attersee (Island in the Attersee)”). I took several photos and spent some quiet time appreciating that beautiful piece. Later that night, Sotheby's sold it in the evening auction for $53.2 million US dollars (Bregman; Schultz). It is the fifth most expensive artworks sold at auction in 2023 (Farrant; “Here Are the 10 Most Expensive Works Sold at Auction in 2023”). This work was owned by a Viennese Jewish couple Paul and Irene Hellmann that were killed by the Nazis in the Holocaust between 1943 and 1944 (Vincent).

Klimt is most famous for his female figure paintings such as Dame mit Fächer (Lady with a Fan), 1918 (Sármány-Parsons). Beside that, the only other known genre he painted is landscape (Néret and Klimt). Klimt took a radical approach to landscape painting in this work. His emphasis on water, interplay with the light and shadow deviate from traditional landscape conventions and use a cropped composition on a square canvas. He demonstrated his avant-garde spirit and artistic vision strongly in this work. His artistic innovation and unique style elevate its valency. Klimt also demonstrated great technical skill and eminent execution by using the combination of Dull Turquoise, Matte Beach, Dark Greige, Silver Pink, Pinkish Grey, Chrome Aluminum, and Silver Pine color with masterful brushwork in short strokes to form the body of the lake (Fig. 3-4). He rendered the work with nuanced blending, and subtle tonal transitions to create an enamoring water reflection, highlighting his admirable technical abilities. This work also captures Klimt's idyllic summer vacations at the Attersee lake, interfusing with his personal intimacy and escapism. This is also a work that was painted before Klimt's transition towards his iconic Golden Period, making this work a crucial piece in understanding his artistic evolution and impact on Austrian Modernism. Also, the previous high sales price of Klimt’s other works also increased its value. For example, “Klimt’s landscape Birch Forest, from 1903, sold for US$104.6 million with fees at Christie’s auction of the collection of the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, setting an auction price record for the artist.” (Schultz). Forty days after the auction of this work, his female figure painting “Lady with a Fan” sold for $108.4 million in Europe and broke the record for the most expensive piece of art, and most expensive painting, ever sold in Europe (Burack). Therefore, the high sales price of different artworks from the same artist convinced collectors to believe his artwork is a good investment option for their wealth.

## Feedback:
Thanks for sharing your example of valuation in art! 

I find this topic to be intrinsically interesting because it addresses that intersection of art, ideas, and culture that is also the course focus. It’s one of the reasons that art examples from other cultures are sometimes not valued the same way by outsiders as they are by insiders. 

Great example! It must have been amazing to see this in person, and especially at such close proximity. It's always fun to realize how many examples of an artist work I have not seen. Some of these artists were so incredibly prolific. I've seen an entire private portfolio of just sketches and drawings from Picasso, some barely scribbles and others of intricate detail.
