## Submission
Hi everyone:

My name is Yung-Fong Tang. You can just call me Frank. I have worked in Silicon Valley as a software engineer since 1993. In summer 2022, I started to pursue my Art History, Associate in Arts degree. I also plan to work on Studio Arts and Painting A.A. degrees after I finish that. I love to cook, paint, read the Bible and judge highschool Team Policy and Parliamentary debate. I was born and grown up in Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C. and would love to travel to Japan and South Korea. My wife and I have two children and a dog. Both my daughter and son studied in De Anza and later in UCSD. Both of them got their master degree and are working now. You can find my paintings and Chinese poems on https://github.com/FrankYFTang/FrankYungFongTangArtLinks to an external site.  I enroll in this particular humanities course because I think it will help me to appreciate and articulate artworks better. See two of my self-portrait below.

Welcome to Arts, Ideas & Values! Over the next weeks we will investigate how art and culture intersect. This is an interdisciplinary introduction to artistic cultural studies. Much of our focus will concentrate on a critical analysis of the dynamic processes through which contemporary cultural values and social constructions of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, social class, religion, and globalization shape and have been shaped by artistic expression. In the process of looking at the development of modern art styles, weâ€™ll apply some special emphasis on the use of art as a tool for social change. We have so much to explore! How wonderful that you have this opportunity to return to school and explore a subject you enjoy!
