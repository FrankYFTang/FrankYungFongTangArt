## Instruction


curation sample of art in the 20th century assignment.pngContent curation is the gathering, organizing and online presentation of content related to a particular theme or topic. In these exercises, the class will be curating a collection of related materials by selecting content to share. The collection will be built around ideas drawn from the curriculum.

When it comes to summarizing the art of the twentieth century - there's a lot to consider. The term modern art has come to denote the innovating and even revolutionary developments in Western painting and the other visual arts since the second half of the 19th century. Embracing a wide variety of movements, styles, theories, and attitudes, the modernity of which resides in a common tendency to repudiate past conventions and precedents in subject matter, mode of depiction, and painting technique alike - applies with particular force to the painting of the last 150 years.

Back in the early 90s a graphic artist named Joan Gratz decided to create a short film called Mona Lisa Descending a Staircase in which she sought to compile and morph 100 of the most recognizable artworks of the 20th century. It was a great success, and at the time, demonstrated a groundbreaking graphic design technique. Watch the video by clicking the link below:

The video is named in part for one of the more controversial cubist compositions by Marcel Duchamp (Nude Descending a Staircase). No doubt you recognized many of the art pieces we've looked at during the quarter as the images on the video morphed from one to the next. Overall, this is an interesting way to visually summarize the class content.

## Feedback:
Thanks for sharing your example! Wow, I am not familiar with this artist's work. It's fascinating to see the juxtaposition of animal type structures on the human form. The close-up is really interesting, I enjoy the way geometric shapes are incorporated to create the texture of the skin. How fun! I'm glad you shared this artist so that I can learn more!

With modern art, it’s always fun to see what inspires people and to hear a little bit of the reason for why this artist’s work appeals to them. Since we all have such different experience and influences, we tend to enjoy very diverse aesthetics. 

It’s fun to get a collective sense of what the class enjoys or finds iconic!

You had a lot of really great engagement with other student posts. I always enjoy reading your comments and seeing the pictures that you share. It always makes me smile to see how excited you are in the photographs.
