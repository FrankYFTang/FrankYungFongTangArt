## Feedback:
Thanks for sharing your example! Wow, I am not familiar with this artist's work. It's fascinating to see the juxtaposition of animal type structures on the human form. The close-up is really interesting, I enjoy the way geometric shapes are incorporated to create the texture of the skin. How fun! I'm glad you shared this artist so that I can learn more!

With modern art, it’s always fun to see what inspires people and to hear a little bit of the reason for why this artist’s work appeals to them. Since we all have such different experience and influences, we tend to enjoy very diverse aesthetics. 

It’s fun to get a collective sense of what the class enjoys or finds iconic!

You had a lot of really great engagement with other student posts. I always enjoy reading your comments and seeing the pictures that you share. It always makes me smile to see how excited you are in the photographs.
