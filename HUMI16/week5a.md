### “The Dance of Life" ( 1899),  Edvard Munch”): art about the artist and his view of the world

For the prompt “#1: Style, Form & Context” I chose to write about, I found the painting The Dance of Life, 1899 (“The Dance of Life, 1899 by Edvard Munch”) by Norwegian symbolist painter Edvard Munch is a work about the artist himself and his view of the world. Munch was born in 1863 and during his childhood he suffered very bad illness, bereavement and the dread of inheriting a mental condition that ran in the family (Skryabin). Munch painted this work when he was 36 years old as the one important work of his “The Frieze of Life” series which consists of 22 of his works (Clohessy), including his most famous work “The Scream” (1893) with several other paintings “The Madonna” (1894), “Ashes” (1894), “Dead Mother and Child” (1893). Three years after he painted this work in 1902, Munch was invited to exhibit at the fifth exhibition of the Berlin Secession. Munch selected these twenty-two works and displayed them under the collective title “Frieze: Cycle of Moments from Life” and divided them into four thematic groups: anxiety, the passing of love, love, and death (Brown). In the painting, we observe a couple dance together in an open field beach side dance party on the green lawn with the sunset in the background. There are four figures in the foreground, three pairs of dancing couples with some other figures in the background. All the male dress formally black and another three female dancing characters in the background dress white. In the center, we see the male figure, presumably representing Munch himself, dancing with a lady who is wearing a long Peachy Pink dress. But there are two other female figures standing and watching them dancing in the foreground, one dress lighter color on the left and one dress in black on the right. The depiction of their face is in three quarter view, facing the center. They look alike and share the same hairstyle. Their eyesights are focusing on the hand holding of the dancing couple. The female figure in the middle, on the other hand, is rendered in a profile view. So… who are they? Apparently they are all depicting the same person! She is Tulla Larsen: “All three resemble Tulla Larsen; the girls dancing in the background may also represent her” (“The Dance of Life”). At that time Larsen and Munch are in an intimate relationship (Schmid). Larsen was a “‘liberated’ upper-class woman” and they traveled to Italy together (Vieira). Larsen wanted Munch to marry her but Munch did not feel he was capable and eventually ended their relationship in 1902 (Loshak; Viederman; Woll). It seems in this painting the three versions of Larsen are looking forward to their union, represented by the hand holding while dancing. The Peachy Pink dressed Larsen is looking at his face, and surrounding her right hand on his neck and shoulder but he is looking down in doubt. While other dancing couples showed strong swinging dance moves in this work, the two main characters seemed to be standing still without much movement. It is a moment Munch danced in his life, not a joyful dance, but dancing around the idea of forming his family without the strength to believe he is capable of enduring yet another family relationship which he presume one day he needs to face the departure by death.

## Feedback:
Thanks for sharing your reflection! It’s fun to look at art as it develops and changes over time – especially in the context of a single culture system. Often we can see major events in the art, as well as shifts in thought, ideology, etc. I enjoyed the example you offered. It's really nice to read about such a variety of art pieces from different well-known artists. I really appreciate your posts because your knowledge of art is so much more expansive than many of the students in the class, it makes it enjoyable for me to see different examples. The details about the identity of the female figures in this work are really interesting, and something I had not read about before.
