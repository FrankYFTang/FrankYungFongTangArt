I Can Do That - Thematic Collage
collage1.jpgCollage is a mixed media art form. Pieces of material such as photographs, fabric swatches, scsraps of paper, and other items are overlapped to create new content. The process focuses on the act of selecting materials for color and texture, and cutting them into a desired shape, before arranging them and pasting them onto the chosen surface. Unlike other art forms that may rely on proficient technical skills which may require more time to master, the artistic expertise of collage lies in the choosing, arranging and affixing.collage 2.jpeg

To summarize, collage describes both a technique and the resulting work of art in which pieces of paper, photographs, fabric and other ephemera are arranged and stuck down onto a supporting surface. Materials overlap one-another to create new compoisitions, and virtually any material which can be applied to a  surface will work. Potential image sources include magazines and periodicals, newspapers, online photo archives, clip-art, photographs (including digital), etc. Think outside the box - look for found materials, do some creative recycling, explore the trashcan!

Try making one:
Decide on a theme or idea that you want to convey in your art.
Collect a minimum of ten (10) images that express this theme or idea. 
Lay out the materials and create a collage from the images. 
Glue or tape the images on a standard 8.5 x 11 piece of paper– cover the entire page!

## Feedback:
Thanks for sharing your collage! This is really fun! I appreciate that you included all of the in-process photographs. Making something artistic should be fun and rewarding but it can also be challenging and frustrating. Sometimes we surprise ourselves with the amazing end-product. Other times what we imagined in our minds doesn’t come out on the page. All of that is part of the process and that’s really what we’re exploring in the Try This exercises – it’s the opportunity to experiment and tease out your creativity. Too often we focus on the product of our effort rather than the journey undertaken. Reframe that idea and think of art-making as an equally important part of the overall process!
