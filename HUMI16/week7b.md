# Week 7 Explore Architecture and Film

## Instruction
Expanding on the idea that art can be culturally determined and socially constructed through public forums, this week you'll view a film in order to identify the unique intersection of architecture and cinema. We don't always think about how important architectural features can prove in the cinematic experience, do we?

Here are two articles to further explore this topic: How Architecture Speaks Through CinemaLinks to an external site. and The Cinematography of ArchitectureLinks to an external site.. I recommend reading both before continuing.

### THE TASK:
1. Select a film of your choosing and include the title of the film and the year of release at the beginning of your review - add a link for the IMDB page if there is one. Next, review the film by responding to the prompts listed below: (20 points)
1. Your post should be a minimum of 250+ words and you should cite resources used. (5 points)
1. Leave substantive* comments on THREE (3) other student posts – select ones who wrote about different examples than you selected. Use this as an opportunity to learn what they have to share. Each comment should be a minimum of 75+ words. (5 points each)

## Feedback:
Thanks for sharing your review of this film! 
So often we watch films for entertainment and don’t always realize how much they manipulate our emotions based on cultural values and ideas. When we consider one aspect such as architecture, it becomes easier to see how the inclusion of places has the ability to impact or change our reactions. Great example!
I watched this film when it first released and wish I had learned more about the story and cultural setting beforehand because  I think I would have better appreciated the experience overall. I like all the images you included in each post - the ones from Bladerunner make me think it would be worth a watch.
