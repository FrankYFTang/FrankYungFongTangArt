### Ride Your Way - Buss, Trucks, Cars

This is a set of three print advertisement Surrealism images designed by the ad agency Y&R for Honda’s campaign “Ride Your Way” in Brazil. The general composition of each image reminds the viewer of a maze, but the walls of the maze are in the shape of a motor vehicle but all are heavily stretched and perpendicularly turned. It surely is a brand image ad to remind people about the power of motor vehicles. The campaign slogan “Ride Your Way” is placed in the corner with the logo of the Honda company. It functions mainly to promote the brand image of the company Honda and intends to connect the image of motor vehicles in all three levels to the brand of Honda because none of these images show a specific design or model of their vehicle but instead only showings general shape of each vehicle. I am not quite sure how effective this advertisement is in terms of promoting people to purchase a Honda car, bus or truck but the design is surely eye-catching and got the attention of the graphic design industry.  

The world illustrated in this set of advertisement images casts a fantasy world. The trucks, buses, and cars are everywhere inside these images. The body of all the vehicles are twisted and turned and therefore no longer can function as what a vehicle should be designed for. Instead, all these vehicles now appear to be objects to isolate us, to hide us, to protect us, to separate us from dangerous or friends. We are all trapped inside their complexity. We live in a world full of motor vehicles, in three different classes, but all connect to Honda. No other places to hide. Just purchase Honda!

## Score: 40/40
## Feedback:
Thanks for sharing your example! I've not seen this one before. I never cease to be amazed how virtually anything can be used to create a selling point. Doesn't seem to matter what the subject is, marketing can find a way to make it work. 

The use of surrealism in modern advertising is a potent method for gaining and influencing people’s attention. While it isn’t always utilized in the same way, painters and other artists often used surrealism in the early part of the twentieth century. The method remains effective as a way to encourage the viewer to assess reality. Often we’re struck by surrealist work because it is visually appealing while also stimulating critical connections. 

Perhaps this is one of the reasons the idea continues to be successful.
