In The Seasons, 1957, I see Lee Krasner’s speechless love toward Pollock

In 1957, one year after Lee Krasner lost her beloved husband Jackson Pollock, her most invested artistic accomplishment by then, she painted The Seasons with oil and house paint on a giant 92 ¾ × 203 ⅞ in canvas in the barn Pollock used to exercise his"drip technique" on the floor. It is a four color monumental Abstract Expression work depicting the seasons of life- her life- A Season in Hell!

The canvas of The Seasons, 1957, is gigantic. It is shockingly half size taller than my height when I saw it in The Whitney and it is twice wider. Krasner uses five colors- big patches of Ruby Red, with gradient on top of the Ivory background, to render several round objects to depict figures, outlined with Peppercorn color curves and surrounded by leaves of vegetation, some in Fern Green, and others in Emerald. Observed from a distance, in the center left, we see a giant Ruby Red peach, facing a Ruby female in the center right, with her hair covering her left eye, a big closed eye, and a pair of deep lips. Her breasts, in Ivory color and Ѡ shape, are illustrated with very simple lines, with a pointed top, as the shape of a peach. These two objects are connected in the lower part within a bigger half circle, and a white circle fruit in the middle of them. Right next to them is a dog figure, with a face split in Ruby and Fern Green. A sad figure, looking down, with an Emerald head and Ruby lips, holding a small peach toward the center, is on the left of the painting.

I believe the figure on the center right is Krasner’s self portrait, and the figure right next to her is her dog Gyp representing the deceased Pollock. The green head figure on the left represents Clement Greenberg, Pollock’s famous artistic critic. In this painting, I see a sad story of  Lee Krasner - her memory of Pollock and their time together with Gyp and Greenberg. The expression of her strokes are bold. She has to climb up and down on a ladder and swiftly wave her arm to render this work. I can sense her strong emotion from this work. I deeply connect to her sadness while I stand in front of it in The Whitney and it draws me to go back there again. It is a powerful work, especially after I understand their story.

## Feedback:
Thanks for sharing your response! 

It’s fun to see what art speaks to a person and then learn why it connects to them at such a visceral level. Appreciating art and connecting to it is so personal that it is fun to experience that briefly through someone else’s perspective. 

Excellent example! This is very interesting. I am not overly familiar with Krasner's works but love the scale of this piece. I find the large color distributions and even the color choices from this time period so different from the more primary tones which seem popular today. It seems Pollock was a difficult partner and surely influenced her artistic responses. The detail images you posted from another paper are very intriguing - I enjoy the comparative aspect of seeing compositions side-by-side like this.
