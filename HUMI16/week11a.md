# Week 11
Instructions for the Artist Profile Project
Artists often produce work that reflect events and obstacles in their personal lives. Learning about these influences can help a viewer to see an artist’s work from an entirely different perspective. Biographical details such as place of residence, marriages, children and employment can alter our view of an artist’s work, as well as make them seem more like ourselves. In this assignment you will select an artist to research and create a profile of their personal life as well as their professional accomplishments. This is less like writing a paper and more like making a visual scrapbook. I want to learn about the artist but I also want to SEE their work. If you make a slide presentation and save it as a PDF file it works quite nicely!

## Instructions:

1. Research to gather the necessary materials and information to complete the assignment.
2. Lay out and design each page to make sure you include all the necessary items.
3. Remember to concentrate on visual information as well as text.
4. Follow the format - piece together the pages of your project as detailed below:

### page 1: cover page
- introduce the artist's full name
- provide a photo of the artist

### page 2: biographical data
- detail where and when the artist was born
- include a map showing the location of birthplace
- identify where and when the artist died
- if they are not dead, identify where they now live

### page 10: sources/references
- list all the sources you used to acquire the information for this project
- include the ENTIRE address or URL for websites
- you must identify where images came from
- provide context for all sources used: books, websites, pictures, etc.

### Reminders:
While we tend to turn to the internet for all our research needs, don’t forget there are wonderful resources in the campus library. Also look for alternative source material at sites like YouTube – there are many documentaries made about art and artists that might be helpful in your search for information.

Be Creative:
- include images/visuals on every page
- use colored fonts and creative layouts
- strive to create an experience, not just a written essay
- details and effort will be considered in grading

* Don't forget to look at the sample project.
