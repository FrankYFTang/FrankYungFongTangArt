**Selected Prompt:** Defining the Elements

**Selected Artworks:** Seven Sacraments Altarpiece, Rogier van der Weyden as shown in Figure 5.17, p145

* **Line:** The work heavily uses vertical lines to render the columns, fences guarding the altar, window frames, and other building structures to direct the viewers toward heaven. In the upper portion, the artist uses curved lines to form arches to create a covered space.
* **Color:** The figures in the foreground were painted mostly in red and some in blue color, with a few in purple. Angles of six colors, white, gold, red, purple, blue, black were rendered in the upper portion of the two side panels. The building structure in the background is rendered in white and gray.
* **Shape:** This triptych is framed with three arches by golden frames. The arch shape of the three frames continues from the frame into the background arches in the background to create unity with the help of several smaller arch shape windows. Grey and white geometric hard-edged shapes dominate the background to illustrate the building structure. 
* **Form:** The artist illustrates the background by using one point linear perspective and geometric shape forming three dimensional forms of arches to illustrate the building. He also uses colorful organic forms, in the shape of angles and human beings in the foreground to create a contrast between grounds.   
* **Value:** Following the principle of atmospheric perspective, the artist renders the floor grids with a darker color near the viewer and lighter farther away from the viewer to create a three dimensional feeling. He also used higher value to render the left edge of the three columns on the right portion of the center panel to illustrate the shade to make the viewer believe the light came from the right side of the painting and the columns are all round. All the columns consistently have higher value on the left edge and lighter value on the right edge to create a unified sense of lighting inside this scene. 
* **Space:** The artist combines one point linear perspective and atmospheric perspective to create a believable space of an enclosed church. All the figures in the paintings are also carefully scaled to follow the proportion under the principle of one point linear perspective. The vanishing point is set on the left edge of the center panel, around the half height of that panel. The atmospheric perspective is most evident on the values used on the floor grids. The works render a very convincing three dimensional space.
* **Texture:** The red and blue cloth of the figure is carefully illustrated with realistic texture to show the quality of the textile. The artist also utilizes one point perspective to render the grids on the floor to create a depth of space. The repetition of the arches and columns in the background structure follows a one point linear perspective to create a realistic three dimensional space in an enclosed environment.

## Feedback:
Thanks for sharing your reflection! Exploring the basic building blocks of art can help us to better grasp the goal of the artist in creating the work. This was fun to read - most of the class selected the first prompt and so it's fun to read something quite different. I think it is satisfying to try and apply some of what is learned to an actual piece of art. Taking this sort of approach to look at an artwork from a specific focus can be very helpful in exploring it from multiple angles. When I was a student first studying art I never thought about the fact that most of the time when we look at something, we simply base our response on whether we find it appealing or not. It wasn't until I learned how to look at construction, the elements displayed, the setting, the way light is presented, and all of those other elements of creation which stimulate or guide the viewer through an experience, that I came to realize just how complicated the interaction between art and viewer can be.
