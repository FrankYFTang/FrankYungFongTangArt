## Feedback:

Thanks for sharing your reflection! When we look at architecture we tend to see it differently than when we view other forms of art. Perhaps it’s the scale or the construction materials but it’s fun to take a moment to consider our reactions to a specific example. Our emotions resonate to different things and this is true of architectural designs as well. If you take a minute and look at examples from around the world and in different time settings, you quickly realize that architecture is deeply embedded in culture. Architecturally this is so interesting. I love the inside bathroom shot because it's fun to see the functional parts of a structure that also get the interesting angles. The triangular stairwell is something else! I so want to visit in person!
