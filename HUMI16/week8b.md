# Week 8 Explore Art and Inequality
## Instruction
Some observers have termed the 20th century the Race Era when it comes to evaluating artistic content. Numerous movements sought to explore and celebrate the arts of specific ethnic, political, and social groups. Your goal is to locate an example of a work that links art with inequality (ethnicity, feminism, colonialism, etc.). Look for examples that explore issues related to racism, gender, and/or social class. 

### THE TASK:
1. Post the image AND the URL so others can view them - try not to duplicate each other. Write a paragraph or two explaining the connection between the image and the issue. (20 points)  
2. Your post should be a minimum of 250+ words and you should cite resources used. (5 points)
3. Leave substantive* comments on THREE (3) other student posts â€“ select ones who wrote about different examples than you selected. Use this as an opportunity to learn what they have to share. Each comment should be a minimum of 75+ words. (5 points each)

Thanks for sharing your example!

Art has long served the purpose of sending messages to the viewer. In the twentieth century we see artists use various mediums to make social and political statements. What makes this such an interesting topic is that it crosses cultural and socio-economic boundaries, as well as many others. Sometimes an artist who provokes us to think or evaluate with their work, also offers insight to what matters to them. We can look at these in both an individual and collective sense and gain a better understanding of issues that impacted public perception over time

This is what makes art so powerful a form of expression. The details, the intricacy of design, the subtleties of nuance are just exquisite. The placement of light and the strength inherent in the musculature of her forearms is really meaningful. Even without knowing the background situation, I think that a viewer responds to those cues. And when you do have the background information, it simply makes the experience that much more potent.
