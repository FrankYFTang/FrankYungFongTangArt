## Submission

#### Prompt Selected: #1: Everywhere a Photo

#### Q1: How often do you take pictures?

I take pictures about three times a day, roughly estimating about 10-20 photos per day. 

#### Q2: What device do you usually use to take them?

I usually use my cell phone- a Pixel 7 Pro that I can use as both my business and personal device.

#### Q3: How much attention do you devote to composition, lighting or arrangement in your pictures?

I devote a fair amount of time to composition, lighting and arrangement when I take photos. However, sometimes I just take a more zoomed out view and crop it down to the part I like. I often use the built- in image editing function to rotate, crop and adjust the photos. I almost always crop the image before I post any of my photos and I roughly post and edit the lighting for half of them. I turned it on automatically back up so all the images are uploaded to the cloud automatically to avoid losing important images if somehow I break my phone.

#### Q4: How do you use the images?

That depends. For any document, bill, or tax record or medical prescription I received, I take a photo and archive it for later reference. For the image I took after I park in the parking lot to make sure I can find my car 30 minutes later, I delete them after I find them and drive home. For the thousands of images I took in museum when I view the artworks, I categorize them and share them on https://github.com/FrankYFTang/FrankYungFongTangArt/tree/main/ArtworkVisitsLinks to an external site. and share some of them to my Facebook wall (https://www.facebook.com/FrankYFTangLinks to an external site. ). For the images I took in daily life, I shared them on my IG ( https://www.instagram.com/frankyftangLinks to an external site. ) and automatically reshare on my Facebook For the images of my artworks, I posted them on my Facebook and also share them on https://github.com/FrankYFTang/FrankYungFongTangArtLinks to an external site. .

#### Q5: How do you think you can improve your photos?

Taking photos from low or high angles for wormview or birdview. Zoom out a little bit more than what I like to frame so I can post editing it easier. In particular, IG always forces you to crop the image to square before posting. Therefore, I need to keep all the important parts in the center square so nothing will be cropped out as in a square format. I will also try to visit the place I want to take a photo in the early morning or under the twilight for better lighting.

## Score: 25/25
## Feedback:

Thanks for sharing your reflection! The amount of connection we have with each other on a global scale today is phenomenal compared to only a few years ago. The visuality of that connection can take many forms and social media makes it even easier to share information. From snapshots of dinner plates to video snippets of social interactions, it can feel like every moment is being documented somehow. When we stop to think of how often to take pictures and what we do with them, it may be surprising to consider how we use this form of documentary to record special moments in our lives.

I like that you use photos for all kinds of things, including normal everyday tasks. I should remember to take a picture of where I park my car at the airport. I always forget the general area by the time I take the return flight. i like the phrases wormview and birdview - I've not heard the wormview before!
