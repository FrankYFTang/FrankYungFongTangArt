# Week 10 Spotlight on Humanities

In general, museums struggle to define the value of what they do to the average community member. Why would someone who has never been to an art museum before, and who has no experience with art, suddenly choose to visit? The benefits of a museum experience are complicated and personal. They depend on a myriad of factors, including expectations of visitor, fulfillment of expectations in previous museum trips, personal history, context, mood, etc. What one person may love about the museum, another may hate. What one visitor thinks or feels in front of a work of art, another may never know.

Art is an interactive experience and museums provide a means of connecting people with objects. They also do so much more…

* Why do we go to museums?
* What compels us?
* What do we hope to see?
* What do we aim to learn while we are there?
* What is a good museum experience?
*  Google has partnered with hundreds of museums, cultural institutions, and archives to host the world’s cultural treasures online. With a team of dedicated Googlers, we are building tools that allow the cultural sector to display more of its diverse heritage online, making it accessible to all. Here you can find artworks, landmarks and world heritage sites, as well as digital exhibitions that tell the stories behind the archives of cultural institutions across the globe.
