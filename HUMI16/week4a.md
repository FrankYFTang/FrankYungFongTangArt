# Week 4 Journal - Artistic Elements
## Instruction

The Task:
1. Let's make an example of Mondrian Painting (also called Neoplasticism)! (10 points) How? Well, here are some instructions. Remember to use the red, yellow and blue of primary colorsLinks to an external site.

Mondrian's style consisted of compositions using only vertical and horizontal lines and rectangular shapes in black, white, gray, and primary colors. Every shape can be created from the most basic geometric shapes and every color can be created from mixing different quantities of primary RED, YELLOW, and BLUE. Mondrian's work went on to be known as NeoplasticismLinks to an external site. – a style he defined as an attempt to reduce art to its simplest, clearest form. As you can see, Piet Mondrian’s work inspired others. mondrian inspired chair.jpgmondrian inspired dress.jpg

While Mondrian worked with oil paints you should use pens and pencils - don't forget the primary colors! Of course you can use a ruler to get nice sharp edges but you might want to try it without one just to see the difference in difficulty.

Try making one:
Draw 6 horizontal lines and 4 vertical lines, make some lines thick and some thin.
You should have a grid with lots of empty spaces.
Choose just a few spaces to fill in with the primary colors (red, yellow, blue).
Leave a lot of white space - the key is to keep it simple.

2. Take a picture of your effort and upload it so I can see the results! (5 points)
3. Write a short explanation about your experience. (10 points)

Reflect on what you discovered during this process.

## Submission

I first decided to paint this work in a portrait orientation. I took my 11x14 Bienfang sketchbook and used a 2H pencil and a ruler to draw a 8 x 11.5 inch rectangle as my work and left about 1.25 in blank on each side. Then I consider how to divide the line and decide to consider the golden ratio. So I calculate the length of 11.5 / (1 + 1.618) and divide the 11.5 into 4.4 inch and 7.1 inch. I draw another 5 horizontal lines in this way, all divided by golden ratio. I then divide the horizontal space by 4 vertical lines, all also using a golden ratio. Then I took the red, blue and yellow color water based ink pens from the set I bought from Daiso. I first painted three cells red. Then I painted four cells blue. Finally I painted three cells yellow. I notice I hesitate to paint two adjacent cells with color. The final result has red and blue spread equally but yellow cells on the upper left. In the last step, I use black pen to draw all lines with a ruler. 

This is a fun project to make. It took me about 30 minutes in total mainly because I am not using watercolor or Acrylic paint but water based ink pens. I am not quite sure what I get from this. I think the black color grid lines contribute a more significant impact than I thought previously.

## Score: 25/25

## Feedback:
Thanks for sharing your results! I love that you applied the golden ratio to your composition. It's interesting to see some of Mondrian’s works in person. Some were rather uninspiring to me but others seemed almost like there was something more that I could almost see. It was an interesting experience. For me, the shift in perception that was unique! It’s fun to try our hand at doing something. Some people discover they like the hands-on approach to art and jump in to explore other mediums. Others discover to their surprise that it’s not always as simple or easy as they once thought. Most of us at least enjoy the process of discovery. Well done - now you are not just a viewer of art, you are also an art-maker!
