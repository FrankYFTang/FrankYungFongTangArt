# Week 10 Explore Public Art
## Instruction
Content curation is the gathering, organizing and online presentation of content related to a particular theme or topic. In these exercises, the class will be curating a collection of related materials by selecting content to share. The collection will be built around ideas drawn from the curriculum.

The term public art properly refers to works of art in any media that have been planned and executed with the specific intention of being sited or staged in the physical public domain, usually outside and accessible to all. Monuments, memorials and civic statuary are perhaps the oldest and most obvious form of officially sanctioned public art. Public art is not confined to physical objects; dance, procession, street theatre and even poetry can be considered part of this style. SourceLinks to an external site.

## Feedback:
This is an amazing example of public art – thank you for sharing! I haven't seen this particular piece of work. I don't actually live in the Bay Area anymore and it's been a couple of years since I visited - this wasn't installed last time I was around. The image of you holding it in your hand is a pretty fun perspective. The interior looks very fluid almost, like it would be smooth to the touch. It's really fun that you can actually get up and be in contact with the piece itself. How fun! 

In many parts of the world and in various times in history, public art has provided a means of communicating information that it might not be safe for the individual to speak aloud. In some case art has been used to make statements against political regimes or ruling parties. In other cases, the public presentation of art is a celebration of ideas, a sign of solidarity, or even a connection to the past. 

The power of public art is that it is visible – often on a grand scale.
