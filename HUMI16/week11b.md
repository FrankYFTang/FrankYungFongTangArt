# Week 11 Navigating Art & Visual Culture

## Instruction

What is Visual Culture?

While we’ve learned about how arts, ideas, and values all reflect and influence each other in our lives, we’ve really been learning about something called Visual CultureLinks to an external site.. We’ve spent time looking not only at objects of art and the people who make them, but also considered how we view art. The field of Visual Culture is focused on the importance of relationships between makers and viewers – through the lens of art objects. Why do we care? Because art is central to human existence and if we better understand its intents and purposes, its interpretations and influences, then it becomes even more meaningful to all parties.

Let’s demonstrate the intersection of art and education and share your artistic ability. It’s time to put on your artist’s beret and offer up some original work. I know, I can hear you saying, “What?!”

Every single person enjoys some form of creativity. Spend some time thinking in terms of what you want to share with the class. If you’re the type of person who thinks in words – perhaps a poem or a brief narrative story would show your creativity? Maybe you practice photography – is there a special photo you want to offer? Do you dance? Sing? Make films? Draw? Juggle? Paint? Construct? Try something completely new and share your experiment! We've explored a lot of material in recent weeks - now you can take the next step - go, Art-Makers!

### The Task:

1. Post an image, a video, or some writing to showcase how you use creativity to connect to the world - be specific about including perspective on how art and ethics are associated. This is pretty open-ended so you can explore options. (25pts)
1. This is easy for some people but terribly challenging for others. It can be a bit scary to open yourself up and share something you’ve created. Be brave!
1. Comment on at least three (3) of your classmates posts and share what you most liked, enjoyed, or appreciated about their creativity. (5pts each)
All session long I’ve encouraged you to leave substantive comments on other people’s posts rather than compliments. Now you get to do the opposite and focus on being purely complimentary! Please be kind.

## Feedback:
Thanks for sharing your response! It’s fun to learn why a specific art form or piece of work is important to a person – it offers a tiny insight to personality and values. Since that’s been one of our primary focuses in this course, I think the example you provided says something about the impact of visual culture on both art and individuals. Excellent work! This was a really neat process seeing your same composition in different mediums. The watercolor is my favorite because I like the warmer tones but they are all wonderful.
