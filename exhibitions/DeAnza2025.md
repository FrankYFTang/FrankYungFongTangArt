This work is inspired by the grid method used by Chuck Close on big face painting, closed in view of rendering by Georgia O’Keeffe. The illustration and rendering technique of grid method is improved by the teaching of Prof. Mencher (in ARTS 4A) and Prof. Huang (in ARTS 4B). The choice of color and composition is influenced by the teaching of Prof. Rodriguez (in ARTS 8 & 12). The rendering of flow art background is taught by Tanya Khachiyan at PBCC VAM workshop.

I took this photo one morning after I got my coffee from Philz Coffee. My dog Buddy is waiting for me inside my car. I took this photo, showing myself, and a tree reflecting from the window of my car, creating an illustration of multiple exposure. But this is only done in a single shot from my cell phone. The sunlight beams down from my coffee, forming a pyramid to frame our companionship together.

I want to show my love to my good friend Philip Tai for his friendship and the donation of his old magazines for me to make collage. Philip is in charge of the worship team at Home of Christ in Cupertino. The design of the work is inspired by Wangechi Mutu’s collage works. Mutu really changed my view about the usage of collage and inspired me to utilize it in my portrait rendering.
