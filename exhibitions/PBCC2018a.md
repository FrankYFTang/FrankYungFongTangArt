My stepfather, Capt. Chun-I Chu, is the Best Gift I received. I lost my biological father when I was 4. When I was 8, I cried out “If there is a God, could you give me a father please?” God answered me through him! My mom married him when I was 10. He knew may pain and treated me as his own. He shown me the heart of a Christ follower and the glory of God. I believe Jesus through his living testimony. I painted this to show my love to him before he, age 97, passed away this May.
