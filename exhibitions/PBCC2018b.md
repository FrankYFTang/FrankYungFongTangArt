Jesus, as a young refugee child, escaped the “Bethlehem massacre by Herod” to Egypt. He experienced and understood the pain and suffering of any refugees faced. Today, we still have a refugee crisis. Jesus said “you did it to one of these brothers of Mine, even the least of them, you did it to Me.” Let us treat any refugees as how we would treat Jesus and remember we are all foreigners and refugees in this world! Jesus was a refugee child and He is the LORD of all refugees! He was there. He is here.

The usual image of “the Lamb of God” in many artworks are portrayed as a white living animal standing high. In this painting, I would like to show viewers a different image- The Lamb who was slant. The Lamb whose body was broken for us. The Lamb whose blood was poured out for our sin. The Lamb who is a sacrifice and is burning on the altar now! Therefore, my rendering of The Lamb of God is one with precious blood and who suffered the brutal killing for us. The one that replaced Isaac and burnt.

As Zacharias who filled with the Holy Spirit prophesied, Jesus, the child, is the horn of our salvation. He is the instrument that announced our salvation, redemption and victory. Listen to His voice! His voice assures us God is with us and God saved us through his own plan. His voice guides us to fight evil in God’s desired path. He is the horn of our salvation- The very same one King David praised to in Psalm 18 and 2 Samuel 22. The one Israelites keep waiting for. The sound anchored us in God’s kingdom.
