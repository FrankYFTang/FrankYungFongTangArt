**Erly Feedback from Instructor:** "...when checking your grid and transfer assignments, although you've done a bunch of them, some of them could be even more accurate. They don't correspond as accurately as they could to the grids. The line quality and shading could be taken to the next level with practice."
  * Drawing 6. Copying Design for a Wall DÃ©coration, 1640-1645, Jacob Jordaens (Flemish 1593-1678), pencil and watercolor pencil
  * Drawing 7. Coping An Oriental Ruler Seated on His Throne, c. 1495, Albrecht Durer (German 1471-152.8)
  * Drawing 8. Copying Self-Portrait, c. 1615, Gian Lorenzo Bernini (Roman 1598-1680)
  * Drawing 9. Copying Saint Sebald, c. 1510, Hans Sebald Beham (German 1500-1550)
  * Drawing 10. Copying 400% of Jackson on my 20 USD bill.
 
**Feedback from Instrcutor:** A (10) "Overall this is one of the best assignments in the class. You've really done a lot of work here and I appreciate how much extra time you spent putting into this assignment. As I go through your different drawings and look over the assignment that you've done there are a couple of things that probably you could work on in terms of all of your drawings not just the grid assignment. For example in the architectural components, such as the columns in one of your copies, Artwork #6, you could work on the verticals of the columns and make the lines flow as one continuous line rather than sketched out as a series of broken lines which defined the contours were edges of the column. In artwork nine, I think would be okay to use a compass to define the circle rather than sketched by hand and in general with some of your drawings I think would be okay to use a ruler if you're having a hard time getting a straight line sketched in. In general you worked harder and longer than most of the other students in the class and you can be proud of this assignment."
