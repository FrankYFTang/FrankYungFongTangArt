* Drawing 1 - with Pencil, including the cube, the sphere, the cone, and the cylinder. 
* Drawing 2 - with sharpie, including the cube, the sphere, the cone, and the cylinder. 

**Feedback from Instructor:** A- (9.3) "This is an excellent effort. And certainly tried to do more than what was assigned. Your first drawing in pencil is very good in terms of the accuracy of most of the perspective. The place where it could be improved the most is in the level of craft and the shading. I'm not sure if the shapes on the far right-hand side are cylinders or if their cubes because the shading and the way in which their rendered is a little messy. In your ink drawings the core shadow and transitional tones on the spheres are problem and I'm not really sure what's going on with all of the elements of light and shadow that seem to be missing there."
