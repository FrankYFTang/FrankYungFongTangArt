# Week 8 Assigment- Still Life (Composition and Meaning) 

**Instruction:**
For this assignment you need to post two drawings of still life. Please base these drawings on a still life that you have set up in your home.  You are making a drawing that should have some meaning to you.  The objects you use should symbolize something or have a meaning.

* **Drawing #1 A symmetrical composition**: You can use whatever medium you feel comfortable with, for example, charcoal, pencil, crayon etc. Please also post a photo of your still life, what your drawing is based on. This drawing should have a concept or a meaning behind it.  Please write one to ten sentences in which you explain what these objects mean to you and why you chose to draw them.

* **Drawing #2 An asymmetrical composition using the rule of thirds**: three to five objects or pieces of fruit. You can use whatever medium you feel comfortable with, for example, charcoal, pencil, crayon etc. Please also post a photo of your still life, what your drawing is based on. This drawing should have a concept or a meaning behind it.  Please write one to ten sentences in which you explain what these objects mean to you and why you chose to draw them.

Submission TBA

* **Drawing 1- Symmetrical Composition**: Coffee is an important thing in my life. It provides energy to me every morning. In this symmetrical composition, I render two cups in a position ready to make coffee. The small left cup is topped with a cone shaped mesh stainless steel pour over coffee dripper and the large right cup is topped with a large size Vietnamese coffee filter without the cover. They are ready for me and waiting for me to put in coffee powder and hot water for my new day. They represent the preparation, resources, and readiness to fully support me for the coming new day. 
* **Drawing 2- Asymmetrical Composition using the Rule of Thirds:** Two empty coffee cups are waiting, but the Vietnamese coffee filter is not ready. Everything is in chaos. The cover is missing, the inner filter is outside and on the table. The filter cup is tilted on top of the larger coffee mug but could roll down to the table at any moment. It represents a chaotic morning in which I am not ready for my day. 

**Feedback from Instrcutor:** "These are very good and attractive drawings. You handled the materials very well and you clearly understand the idea having to do with composition. Your descriptions are very good too.

I like to give everyone some advice on how to improve their drawings and so there are two things that I think you might benefit from.

First off, the drawings might be taken to the next step up by choosing to draw stuff from a high-level rather than looking down from above and also creating more of a contrast in light and shadow in terms of how you flip the still life.

Second, the elliptical shapes on top of the coffeemakers and objects are slightly inaccurate and you may want to read review about how to draw elliptical shapes."
