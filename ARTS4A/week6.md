**Feedback from Instructor:** A (10) "As usual these are excellent drawings and you gone way beyond the restraints or confines of the assignment I appreciate how hard you're working in this class. One of the things that could be improved if you are looking for me to highlight some areas for improvement would be to be a little bit more crafted a little bit tidier and a little less messy in terms of some of your shading and your mark making however, these are really great assignments for beginning drawing class."
