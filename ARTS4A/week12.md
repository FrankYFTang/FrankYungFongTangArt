**Instruction:** For this assignment you need to post one drawing in which you include two or more of the following elements, still life objects or props, a human figure, in an environment that shows the use of one or two point perspective.

Title: “Friendship- Reunion after 36 Years” (pencil, vine charcoal, black markers)

In this work, I use two photos I took recently as reference to illustrate a scene of “Friendship- Reunion after 36 Years”. My classmate and roommate in Fall 1982 recently visited me from Taiwan. I brought him to visit the Memory Church in Stanford University and took a very nice photo in a two-point linear perspective. I also have a selfie with him separately. 

I combine elements in these two photos and make some alteration of the distance of element to the viewpoint to create this work. Most of the rendering is done by pencils. I also use vine charcoal to enhance some blackness of the shadow and black makers to outline some parts. 

The background is based on the photo I took from the Southwest corner in the Main Quad outside the Memory Church. To fulfill the “still life” requirement, I moved the relative position of the hanging lamp closer to the viewpoint to render it larger with details. I intentionally do not depict other hanging lamps to keep the focus of the viewers on this particular one. I also move Kris, my roommate closer to the viewpoint so the figure is bigger. I superimposed myself from the selfie I took in another photo to the lower left corner. This work illustrates our 36 years of friendship. We seldom communicate with each other in the last 30 years due to our physical distance. However, when he told me he would come, I was so happy to host him and reconnect with him. In the work, the two hallways meet together in this spot, symbolizing our very different ways after our college life eventually meet again together at this spot. The hanging lamp symbolizes the sparkling excitement of our reunion, 36 years later.
