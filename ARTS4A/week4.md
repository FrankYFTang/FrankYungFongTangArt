**Feedback from Instructor:** A- (9.3) "Hello Frank, These are very good drawings and as usual your work is quite good. Some places where your work and brought to the next level or improved would be to make your shapes more accurate. For example, some of your elliptical shapes and cast shadows are inaccurate in shape. The reflected light and core shadow in your cylinders should be stripped or bands rather than curved shapes. Please consult the video that I made on Friday and uploaded. In general the mark making is very good and the hatch marks make a lot of sense in your drawings."
