# Week 3 Exta Credit- Extra Credit: Extra Drawings of Basic Shapes

**Instruction**
Please create a minimum of four drawings (eight would be optimal) from the PDF Extra Basic Shapes to Draw.pdf. 

There are several different methods that you can choose to use.  (Please watch the video and read the PDF to learn how to do it.)

Then you will need to photograph your work (Please watch the video that explains how to photograph your work) and post it to the discussion section for this week.

Youâ€™re welcome to experiment and try any mediums you like.

Please submit this assignment by Friday night at midnight.

(Here's a checklist that you should review and maybe correct your drawings.)

I've looked over some that have already been turned it and they look pretty good but I wanted to share some thoughts about what I'll be looking for.

1. The shape of the cast shadows.  For example, does the shadow under the sphere look like a blob or an ellipse?  You may need to go back and compare your drawing more closely against the reference images and review the lessons that are available.  Some of the cast shadows of things like the cylinders look like blobs in some of the drawings and they should be more closely observed.
2. Are the edges of the objects set off by lines or by shading? There should be no hard outlines around the shapes and defining the planes in a smoothly shaded shape.  The edge should appear because there is a contrast between the planes and or the planes against the background or the surface they are resting on.
3. Is the shading accurate? For example, on a cone, sphere, and or cylinder the elements of highlight, transitional tones, core shadow and reflected light should be distinct and identifiable.  Is the reflected or ambient light too bright?  If it is as bright as the highlight then it's too bright.
4. How accurate and smooth is the shading? Is it messy or splotchy?  Do the tones move smoothly in terms of their transitions from shade to shade?  Are the background and tabletop smoothly and completely shaded?

**Feedback from Instructor:** A (10) "Thank you so much for doing so much extra work. These drawings are very good! To improve on the drawings, I think the backgrounds and planes could have been rendered out more. In the background a complete tone across the whole drawing would help to unify it. Sometimes you are missing reflected light or over emphasize the reflected light. Edges and shapes could be even more accurate. Nevertheless, this is fantastic work."
