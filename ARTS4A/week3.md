**Erly Feedback from Instructor:** "For the basic shapes, the ellipses on top of the cylinders are inaccurate, and on first appraisal things could be neater, better crafted and the steps in the shading could be more accurate. It looks like your missing some tones especially in the reflected or bounce light."

**Feedback from Instructor:** A- (9.3) "These are all excellent drawings and you certainly gone above and beyond with the minimum of the required amount of drawings was for the assignment. I know that you are working really hard and I think that you might be disappointed if I didn't give you some tips on how to improve your drawings so I'm going to tell you what kinds of things are inaccurate. However, I want you to understand that these are excellent drawings and that they are perfectly appropriate for 100% for this level of project. The top of the cylinder in your upper right-hand drawing could be better drawing of an ellipse. The edges of some of the shapes could be straighter and better drawn. The reflected light on the cylinder in your first drawing in the upper right-hand corner is too bright. In some of your drawings for example in drawing three, the shapes are not very straight or well-defined especially in the cones. Nevertheless overall you've done an excellent job here"
