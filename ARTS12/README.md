# ARTS 12 Design and Color
I am taking ARTS 8 Two-Dimensional Design in De Anza College during Winter 2024 (Jan 8 - March 29, 2024). This repo archived my work for this course. My professor is Eugene Rodriguez.

## Project One - Scene and Not Seen: Depicting Inequality 
### Instruction from the professor:
* Materials: Acrylic paint on Bristol board
* Objectives:
  1. To use key elements and principles of design in conjunction with the subtractive system primaries in order to move the viewer through 2D space,
  1. To visually balance the subtractive system primaries,
  1. To define for yourself the connections between images and cultural values, i.e., How does a viewer look at two images and then comprehend the artist’s intentions?
* Viewing:
  * History of Cinema-The Foreign Wave (1940-1970), 2014, TRT-10:13 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw6N2_ET8_kLinks 
  * How Jean-Luc Godard Revolutionized Film, 2018, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZGLhgW6RwcLinks .
  * Reading: Our Predecessors Built a World of Winners and Losers. It's Time for Something Different, by Darren Walker, NYTimes, 9/19/22.

1. First I would like you to watch the two films listed above in Viewing and read the article by Darren Walker. Then I would like you write a 1–2-page response. (See required technical specs below) What did you find interesting about the Foreign Wave on cinema? What did you not know? What did you think of Godard’s creativity as an artist? Remember to keep in mind that this is more than 50 years ago. What did the Walker article make you critically aware of living in our era of Global Order? What do you think is not working on the global stage regarding the "have's and have not's"? As you write think of how you would present your observations as an artist in an interview.*This writing reflection is meant for you to practice how you explain your creative process from inspiration all the way to final form.  *This is the beginning of your final paper for the quarter. This will have to do with all that you experienced and learned from the class. More on this next week.
1. To begin your creative process I would like you think about the ways in which the current pandemic has highlighted our society’s inequalities. This process could find its inspiration in the ways we have been able to purchase our food such as delivery services or in person with masks. Another area of inspiration could be how you are receiving your education. Remember that the objective is to highlight inequality and have an artist’s point-of-view (POV). This is all called brainstorming. I do this on drawing paper with a 2B pencil. 
1. Now you are ready to begin preliminary sketches. Take two images from your brainstorming session and sketch them out on paper. These could be photos of your own or from the Internet. I will demonstrate using a shopping cart and a box from the food delivery service, Good Eggs. Is your intention to be neutral >> the images are the same size? Are you being accusational and one is bigger than the other? Are they both centered or are they pushed to the sides? You must divide your space exactly in half. However, this can be done horizontal, vertical, or on the diagonal. Remember that your job as a visual artist is to keep your viewer engaged. *REMEMBER GODARD = Your intention is to push the viewer to think. *I would review the Elements and Principles of Design in Module Week One for reference.  I have chosen to highlight "Inequality" by making my shopping cart red hot=EMERGENCY and it collides right into the neighboring space. I have chosen yellow to spell out Good Eggs but have spread it all over the space (and broken it up) to make the viewer move. Then to make it more visible I have outlined it in blue. In the end I have used Godard's directive of making the viewer think about what the two images have to do with one another. At the same time I have used the subtractive system primaries (red, yellow and blue) to activate the space (made it interesting).
1. For your materials, you will be using one sheet of Bristol board, sized at 14” x 17”. You will be using three colors right from the jar, Ultramarine Blue (UB), Yellow Medium Azo (YMA), and Naphthol Red (NR). These are the power colors. How much you use of each color is your decision. Red is hot, Blue is cool, and Yellow is light in value. You cannot combine them. Your final painting will have a two-inch frame. *Finally, make sure to go over your preliminary lines that formed your border and dividing line with a black fine tip sharpie.
