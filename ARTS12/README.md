## Project One - Scene and Not Seen: Depicting Inequality 
### Instruction from the professor:
* Materials: Acrylic paint on Bristol board
* Objectives:
  1. To use key elements and principles of design in conjunction with the subtractive system primaries in order to move the viewer through 2D space,
  1. To visually balance the subtractive system primaries,
  1. To define for yourself the connections between images and cultural values, i.e., How does a viewer look at two images and then comprehend the artist’s intentions?
* Viewing:
  * History of Cinema-The Foreign Wave (1940-1970), 2014, TRT-10:13 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw6N2_ET8_kLinks 
  * How Jean-Luc Godard Revolutionized Film, 2018, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZGLhgW6RwcLinks .
  * Reading: Our Predecessors Built a World of Winners and Losers. It's Time for Something Different, by Darren Walker, NYTimes, 9/19/22.

1. First I would like you to watch the two films listed above in Viewing and read the article by Darren Walker. Then I would like you write a 1–2-page response. (See required technical specs below) What did you find interesting about the Foreign Wave on cinema? What did you not know? What did you think of Godard’s creativity as an artist? Remember to keep in mind that this is more than 50 years ago. What did the Walker article make you critically aware of living in our era of Global Order? What do you think is not working on the global stage regarding the "have's and have not's"? As you write think of how you would present your observations as an artist in an interview.*This writing reflection is meant for you to practice how you explain your creative process from inspiration all the way to final form.  *This is the beginning of your final paper for the quarter. This will have to do with all that you experienced and learned from the class. More on this next week.
1. To begin your creative process I would like you think about the ways in which the current pandemic has highlighted our society’s inequalities. This process could find its inspiration in the ways we have been able to purchase our food such as delivery services or in person with masks. Another area of inspiration could be how you are receiving your education. Remember that the objective is to highlight inequality and have an artist’s point-of-view (POV). This is all called brainstorming. I do this on drawing paper with a 2B pencil. 
1. Now you are ready to begin preliminary sketches. Take two images from your brainstorming session and sketch them out on paper. These could be photos of your own or from the Internet. I will demonstrate using a shopping cart and a box from the food delivery service, Good Eggs. Is your intention to be neutral >> the images are the same size? Are you being accusational and one is bigger than the other? Are they both centered or are they pushed to the sides? You must divide your space exactly in half. However, this can be done horizontal, vertical, or on the diagonal. Remember that your job as a visual artist is to keep your viewer engaged. *REMEMBER GODARD = Your intention is to push the viewer to think. *I would review the Elements and Principles of Design in Module Week One for reference.  I have chosen to highlight "Inequality" by making my shopping cart red hot=EMERGENCY and it collides right into the neighboring space. I have chosen yellow to spell out Good Eggs but have spread it all over the space (and broken it up) to make the viewer move. Then to make it more visible I have outlined it in blue. In the end I have used Godard's directive of making the viewer think about what the two images have to do with one another. At the same time I have used the subtractive system primaries (red, yellow and blue) to activate the space (made it interesting).
1. For your materials, you will be using one sheet of Bristol board, sized at 14” x 17”. You will be using three colors right from the jar, Ultramarine Blue (UB), Yellow Medium Azo (YMA), and Naphthol Red (NR). These are the power colors. How much you use of each color is your decision. Red is hot, Blue is cool, and Yellow is light in value. You cannot combine them. Your final painting will have a two-inch frame. *Finally, make sure to go over your preliminary lines that formed your border and dividing line with a black fine tip sharpie.

### Feedback From Classmates:
* **From NH**: "Hi Frank, Really great work with a clear concept behind it. I do love how you make use of everyday items in your art. They give natural textures that make me wonder how you create that kind of patterns. I appreciate the way you want to separate the upper high-income class against the living conditions of tramps. I believe you use all primary colors in both scenes for a cohesive picture, but I would appreciate if you manipulate them to evoke chaotic feelings for the lower part.  Also, since the same techniques are applied in both scenes, the sponge stamps on the house windows and the red lines of paper cuts make the upper scene look like it is as dirty as the lives under the bridge. Other than that, the rest of the rendering enhances their respective scenes. Best regards, "
* **From BL**: "Hi NH and Frank! 
I cannot agree with NH more on how creative Frank is with giving so many textures in his painting! Frank did creatively interpret the objectives and guidelines in his painting by not simply filling out colors in shapes but using different tools to help him achieve a more interesting piece. Although I have to say, I love the idea of the different textures, but when I looked at the piece at first it looked a bit messy nothing really stood out to me. I think there can be more work done in terms of principles of design, especially work on contrast and emphasis, I think it would help Frank a lot to convey the message he wants to convey to the viewers! On the other hand, after carefully examining Frank's piece even before reading what he wrote, I could tell what the artist is trying to say about inequality in this country, which is between the rich and the poor. Overall, very nice analysis Nyi, and a very creative piece by Frank!"
* **From AL**: "Answer to the prompts: 
  1. Did the project effectively use the visual characteristics of the primaries: red, yellow, and blue, to move the viewer through the space?
  1. What do you think the artist is trying to say about inequality in this country?
  * Hi Frank Yung-Fong! I'm truly captivated by the overall composition of your artwork. Even before reading your explanation, I was drawn to the diverse texture elements in the top and bottom paintings. Initially, I interpreted the house as a representation of staying home during COVID, and the second part symbolized the freedom to venture into nature post-COVID. However, your insightful explanation unveiled a deeper message about the coexistence of million-dollar homes and homelessness in the Bay Area.The addition of blue to the roof caught my eye, especially the seamless blend with the right side of the house, creating a visual connection and suggesting the presence of a tree in the bottom half. Your painting invites multiple interpretations, and I find myself analyzing various elements. I appreciate your explanation of the texture creation process, as it enhances my understanding of your work. I can imagine the considerable time and effort invested in this piece.I'm curious to know if you worked on this in a single day or over a span of a few days? I faced similar challenges with the opacity of the yellow, particularly in the background of my left side (you can scroll down to see mine). I am genuinely proud of your achievement, and I look forward to seeing more of your artwork throughout this quarter."

### Feedback From Classmates:
* **From CC**: "
  * Did the project activate the space and make the viewer look at the entire composition, or not?
    * Yes, I actually want to look at the whole composition. I like that the background has these stripes that draw me in to the person that's front and center. The dark contrast of the binoculars has that as the focal point and everything else spreads out from there. The title at the bottom is framed to make it distinct and clean, as well.
  * Did the project effectively use the visual charcteristics of a monochromatic color scheme to move the viewer through the space?
    * This design piece runs through the whole spectrum of monochrome color scheme. The hair, clothing, and shading around the face and hands help frame the person in the center. The binoculars are a very focal element, highlighting how reading the news makes us more aware and curious of the world around us. The lighter tones in the lenses, hands, face, and hair help shape the person and objects as distinct and recognizable. There was clearly a lot of effort put into this!"
* **From ADR**:
  * "Hi, Yungfong! I really liked your artwork. The bright colors and different shades make it very eye-catching.
  * **Did the project effectively activate the space and draw the viewer's attention to the entire composition?**
  * In my opinion, you used the space effectively. Although there is a lot to see in the painting, it doesn't distract from the main subject. It's evident that you put a lot of thought into each part of the painting.
  * **Did you creatively interpret the objectives and guidelines, particularly the theme, of the project?**
  * I think you did a great job interpreting the project and making it your own. As I mentioned before, you did a great job thinking over the piece. There is a lot of care put into it, from the choice of colors to the text to the binoculars. Overall, great job, and keep up the good work!"
* **From XL**:
  * Hi Yunfong, From your paintings, I feel your skillful use of color and your appropriate use of painting area. I can see that you use symmetrical designs to highlight the ideas you want to express, and you use solid colors. to activate the whole picture and make me feel inspired. Besides that, I can see that you used color to fill in the background of the picture, which makes the whole space more open and makes the viewer feel at ease.

## Project Four
### Instruction from the professor:
#### The Television Age of Animation: 1958-1985
#### Materials: Acrylic paint on Bristol board
#### Objectives: 
1. To use key elements and principles of design along with value and saturation in order to move the viewer through 2D space,
2.  To create a composition that draws conceptual and aesthetic inspiration from the Television Age of Animation: 1958-1985,
3. To define for yourself the connections between images and cultural values AND in particular how the climate crisis affects the world and the future of society.

#### Viewing:
1. History of Animation, 2014, TRT-24:14 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sfzy05M-nzYLinks to an external site.
 How to Be a Good Ancestor, Roman Krznaric, 2020, TRT-7:05 https://www.ted.com/talks/roman_krznaric_how_to_be_a_good_ancestor?language=en#t-399518.
3. Harry Smith, Heaven and Earth Magic(excerpt), 1960, TRT-8:42 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh0vVK9LpZU.
4. George Dunning, Yellow Submarine, 1969, Official Trailer, TRT-3:42 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefJAtG-ZKI. 
5. Réne Laloux, Les Escargots, 1966, TRT-11:13 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lYsDhyUzy4 
#### Process:
1. First I would like you to watch documentaries #1 and #2 as an introduction to the project. Then you will need to watch all three shorts on the three animators to choose your inspiration for the project. They are all very different so take your time to watch them. Next I would like you to write a one-page response. (See required technical specs below) What were one or two things you learned about the Television Age of Animation: 1958-1985? Why did you choose the animator you did for the project?
2.  Preliminary sketches. Now that you have chosen one animator for inspiration you will need to decide on a concept concerning the global climate crisis. After watching the video, How To Be A Good Ancestor, what do you want to say about our predicament? Will you propose solutions such as flying cars that don’t use fossil fuels or will you depict a meeting between earthlings and other planetary lives?
3. You are creating a story board for a one-minute animated film. This is not the actual animation. This is the concept for your film. You would use this in your portfolio to communicate your idea and what happens.
4. You will have six equal frames to depict your action. The elements of design are important here such as shape (what kinds of shapes) and space (where does the action happen, top to bottom or left to right?). The principles of design are also important, balance, rhythm/movement and emphasis to name a few.
5.– For your materials, you will be using one sheet of Bristol board, sized at 14” x 17” and black and white acrylic paint. Your final painting will have six equal frames measuring 4” in height and 5” in width. I will illustrate this in my PowerPoint Presentation for you to view. You will also write a brief description of the action below each frame. I will also have this illustrated in my PowerPoint Presentation. Neatness matters!
6. For your colors you will be choosing one of three color schemes. These schemes are all visually explained on the color wheel from your art kit. You can use as many tints, tones and shades as you want as well as desaturation. You cannot mix the colors from your scheme nor can you use pure black or white.
#### Color Schemes

* Analogous > Using three colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel. Example: Yellow-Orange, Yellow, Yellow-Green
* Triad > Using three colors equally spaced from each other on the color wheel. Example: Orange, Violet and Green. (Do not use the primaries for this assignment)
* Split Complementary > Using any color with the two colors on each side of its complement. Example: Green with Red-Orange and Red-Violet

Make sure there are clean borders. You may have to cut your windows out of a clean piece of Bristol and place it over your painting.
