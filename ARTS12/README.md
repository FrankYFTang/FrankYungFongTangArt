## Project One - Scene and Not Seen: Depicting Inequality 
### Instruction from the professor:
* Materials: Acrylic paint on Bristol board
* Objectives:
  1. To use key elements and principles of design in conjunction with the subtractive system primaries in order to move the viewer through 2D space,
  1. To visually balance the subtractive system primaries,
  1. To define for yourself the connections between images and cultural values, i.e., How does a viewer look at two images and then comprehend the artist’s intentions?
* Viewing:
  * History of Cinema-The Foreign Wave (1940-1970), 2014, TRT-10:13 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw6N2_ET8_kLinks 
  * How Jean-Luc Godard Revolutionized Film, 2018, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZGLhgW6RwcLinks .
  * Reading: Our Predecessors Built a World of Winners and Losers. It's Time for Something Different, by Darren Walker, NYTimes, 9/19/22.

1. First I would like you to watch the two films listed above in Viewing and read the article by Darren Walker. Then I would like you write a 1–2-page response. (See required technical specs below) What did you find interesting about the Foreign Wave on cinema? What did you not know? What did you think of Godard’s creativity as an artist? Remember to keep in mind that this is more than 50 years ago. What did the Walker article make you critically aware of living in our era of Global Order? What do you think is not working on the global stage regarding the "have's and have not's"? As you write think of how you would present your observations as an artist in an interview.*This writing reflection is meant for you to practice how you explain your creative process from inspiration all the way to final form.  *This is the beginning of your final paper for the quarter. This will have to do with all that you experienced and learned from the class. More on this next week.
1. To begin your creative process I would like you think about the ways in which the current pandemic has highlighted our society’s inequalities. This process could find its inspiration in the ways we have been able to purchase our food such as delivery services or in person with masks. Another area of inspiration could be how you are receiving your education. Remember that the objective is to highlight inequality and have an artist’s point-of-view (POV). This is all called brainstorming. I do this on drawing paper with a 2B pencil. 
1. Now you are ready to begin preliminary sketches. Take two images from your brainstorming session and sketch them out on paper. These could be photos of your own or from the Internet. I will demonstrate using a shopping cart and a box from the food delivery service, Good Eggs. Is your intention to be neutral >> the images are the same size? Are you being accusational and one is bigger than the other? Are they both centered or are they pushed to the sides? You must divide your space exactly in half. However, this can be done horizontal, vertical, or on the diagonal. Remember that your job as a visual artist is to keep your viewer engaged. *REMEMBER GODARD = Your intention is to push the viewer to think. *I would review the Elements and Principles of Design in Module Week One for reference.  I have chosen to highlight "Inequality" by making my shopping cart red hot=EMERGENCY and it collides right into the neighboring space. I have chosen yellow to spell out Good Eggs but have spread it all over the space (and broken it up) to make the viewer move. Then to make it more visible I have outlined it in blue. In the end I have used Godard's directive of making the viewer think about what the two images have to do with one another. At the same time I have used the subtractive system primaries (red, yellow and blue) to activate the space (made it interesting).
1. For your materials, you will be using one sheet of Bristol board, sized at 14” x 17”. You will be using three colors right from the jar, Ultramarine Blue (UB), Yellow Medium Azo (YMA), and Naphthol Red (NR). These are the power colors. How much you use of each color is your decision. Red is hot, Blue is cool, and Yellow is light in value. You cannot combine them. Your final painting will have a two-inch frame. *Finally, make sure to go over your preliminary lines that formed your border and dividing line with a black fine tip sharpie.

### Feedback From Classmates:
* **From NH**: "Hi Frank, Really great work with a clear concept behind it. I do love how you make use of everyday items in your art. They give natural textures that make me wonder how you create that kind of patterns. I appreciate the way you want to separate the upper high-income class against the living conditions of tramps. I believe you use all primary colors in both scenes for a cohesive picture, but I would appreciate if you manipulate them to evoke chaotic feelings for the lower part.  Also, since the same techniques are applied in both scenes, the sponge stamps on the house windows and the red lines of paper cuts make the upper scene look like it is as dirty as the lives under the bridge. Other than that, the rest of the rendering enhances their respective scenes. Best regards, "
* **From BL**: "Hi NH and Frank! 
I cannot agree with NH more on how creative Frank is with giving so many textures in his painting! Frank did creatively interpret the objectives and guidelines in his painting by not simply filling out colors in shapes but using different tools to help him achieve a more interesting piece. Although I have to say, I love the idea of the different textures, but when I looked at the piece at first it looked a bit messy nothing really stood out to me. I think there can be more work done in terms of principles of design, especially work on contrast and emphasis, I think it would help Frank a lot to convey the message he wants to convey to the viewers! On the other hand, after carefully examining Frank's piece even before reading what he wrote, I could tell what the artist is trying to say about inequality in this country, which is between the rich and the poor. Overall, very nice analysis Nyi, and a very creative piece by Frank!"
* **From AL**: "Answer to the prompts: 1. Did the project effectively use the visual characteristics of the primaries: red, yellow, and blue, to move the viewer through the space?2. What do you think the artist is trying to say about inequality in this country?Hi Frank Yung-Fong! I'm truly captivated by the overall composition of your artwork. Even before reading your explanation, I was drawn to the diverse texture elements in the top and bottom paintings. Initially, I interpreted the house as a representation of staying home during COVID, and the second part symbolized the freedom to venture into nature post-COVID. However, your insightful explanation unveiled a deeper message about the coexistence of million-dollar homes and homelessness in the Bay Area.The addition of blue to the roof caught my eye, especially the seamless blend with the right side of the house, creating a visual connection and suggesting the presence of a tree in the bottom half. Your painting invites multiple interpretations, and I find myself analyzing various elements. I appreciate your explanation of the texture creation process, as it enhances my understanding of your work. I can imagine the considerable time and effort invested in this piece.I'm curious to know if you worked on this in a single day or over a span of a few days? I faced similar challenges with the opacity of the yellow, particularly in the background of my left side (you can scroll down to see mine). I am genuinely proud of your achievement, and I look forward to seeing more of your artwork throughout this quarter."

### Feedback From Classmates:
* **From CC**: "
  * Did the project activate the space and make the viewer look at the entire composition, or not?
    * Yes, I actually want to look at the whole composition. I like that the background has these stripes that draw me in to the person that's front and center. The dark contrast of the binoculars has that as the focal point and everything else spreads out from there. The title at the bottom is framed to make it distinct and clean, as well.
  * Did the project effectively use the visual charcteristics of a monochromatic color scheme to move the viewer through the space?
    * This design piece runs through the whole spectrum of monochrome color scheme. The hair, clothing, and shading around the face and hands help frame the person in the center. The binoculars are a very focal element, highlighting how reading the news makes us more aware and curious of the world around us. The lighter tones in the lenses, hands, face, and hair help shape the person and objects as distinct and recognizable. There was clearly a lot of effort put into this!"
