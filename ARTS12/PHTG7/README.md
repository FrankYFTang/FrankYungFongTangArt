# PHTG7 Exploring Visual Expression
I took PHTG7 Exploring Visual Expression in De Anza College during Fall 2024 (September 23 - December 9-13, 2024). This repo archived my work for this course. My professor is Sita Bhattacharji.

## Assignment 1 Color, Pattern, Curve and Shadow

* Classmate Feedback: 
  * **Philip Ossenbruggen:** Your pattern shadow and curve look good although the color picture could be brighter. I noticed that all of your pictures could fit under the pattern section.
  * **Sett Htoo:** You bring art to daily things that are ordinary. As if you slowed down time to appreciate a moment. These are awesome.
* **Teacher Feedback:** You have done an excellent job on all of these images, Frank. You have played around with distance, angle of view and perspective very nicely. My favorite is the "TurtleBuddyAndI", however!

## Assignment 2 Depth of Field

* Classmate Feedback: 
  * **Albert Gomez:** Hi Yungfong, Nice photos. I think you fulfilled the requirements of the assignment fine. I like the selection of the dog and the pine cone. Nice and clear photos.
  * **Sett Htoo:** Hello! I absolutely love the images under Aperature. They both have such a homey feeling to them as the warm colors complement each other so well. The images under Distance from Subject are also so beautiful. I love how the pinecone complements the fall-ish background as the image has mainly brown tones in it. The images under Focal Length of Lens are so beautiful! The dog is adorable and I love how the white color of the dog contrasts the background and just brightens up the whole image. Overall, I really loved all your images. I think you're set to be a really great photographer :D
  * **Dylan Le:** Great Job, I am amazed by how the photos look. I love how warming each of the photos look and how there's a consistent theme between each photos. I also like how you were able to get all these photos on campus. Great job
* **Teacher Feedback:** What an incredibly cute dog...! Great job and great images, Yungfong! You have shown the changes in depth of field very nicely in each of these sets of images.

## Assignment 3 Written Assignment

* **Teacher Feedback:** Though I would like you to have discussed 1 or 2 specific images of Titarenko's, you have done a great job, Yungfong. I am glad that you enjoyed the work of Alexey Titarenko and Arnold Newman. These are very good discussions and I get the feeling that you really looked at and thought about the work of these two fairly different photographers.

## Assignment 4 Motion
* Classmate Feedback: 
  * **Natalie Nguyen:**  Hi Yungfong, your photos amazed me because of how clear the quality of your camera is! I thought your pictures were great and matched the instructions of the assignment perfectly. Great job! 
  * **Nathan Wong:** Hey Yungfong, I really like the picture of the fountain as that is an object that I would not expect to be depicted as an object in motion. I like your creativity when it comes to photography. good job overall!
* **Teacher Feedback:**  
  * Set 1: Excellent! I love the dreamy, almost surreal affect of the water in motion...
  * Set 2: Lovely images. You could have used a faster shutter speed--perhaps 1/250 or 1/500 to really freeze the motion of the water, but you have done a good job on these.
  * Set 3: Great job, Frank! Both images show the Panning effect beautifully. I particularly like how the "Redshopper's" feet are moving faster than her body.
