# PHTG7 Exploring Visual Expression
I took PHTG7 Exploring Visual Expression in De Anza College during Fall 2024 (September 23 - December 9-13, 2024). This repo archived my work for this course. My professor is Sita Bhattacharji.

## Assignment 1 Color, Pattern, Curve and Shadow

* Classmate Feedback: 
  * Philip Ossenbruggen: Your pattern shadow and curve look good although the color picture could be brighter. I noticed that all of your pictures could fit under the pattern section.
  * Sett Htoo: You bring art to daily things that are ordinary. As if you slowed down time to appreciate a moment. These are awesome.
*  Teacher Feedback:
  * You have done an excellent job on all of these images, Frank. You have played around with distance, angle of view and perspective very nicely. My favorite is the "TurtleBuddyAndI", however!
