The painting of Kris, Acrylic, 2025

 

One of my friends, Kris Wang, who lives in East Lansing, Michigan, willingly gave me the permission to use his photo to paint a large portrait. This article details the steps I took to complete this work.

First, I examined all the photos in his Facebook account to identify a good photo as a reference photo. I found it on Aug 6, 2025. 
Since I plan to paint a 48x60 large size Acrylic portrait, I first conduct several studies on a smaller scale to understand the challenge portion on his face and my own challenges while rendering his face:
I used a micron pen to draw a sketch in 8x10 and completed on Aug 9, 2025, as study. This process helped me to identify the lines and details on his face. 
I then used color pastel to render a study of the same image on a 14x17 bristle and completed on Aug 10, 2025, as study. This process helps me to decide the color usage and the design of the background. 
After completing these two studies, I started to plan my big size painting. I used Adobe Photoshop to create a mask to filter out the background and use some red color abstract photos to create an abstract background. I created a 16x20 guide on the image.
To start the painting, I use a pencil to mark every three inches on the canvas to form the intersection points of the 16x20 grid. 
I then use yellow acrylic paint to trace the basic shape of the photo. 
I then color the background with red acrylic paint.
I then put down the basic layer of the face and render the glasses.
Next, I use pure art technique to render the black and white flower on his shirt
After the shirt portion is dry, I use pour art technique with black, red and white paint to render the left background of the painting, then the right background. 
After both sides of the background are dry, I drip some black paint to make both sides coherent. 
Then I start to use short strokes to put up more layers of color on his face. 
And I use brushes, with black and blue paint to illustrate his hair and facial hair.
I apply some white paint on his hair and facial hair
Finally I signed my name on Aug 31, 2025 to finish the work.

## Feedback
Thanks for sharing your response! 

This kind of intelligence is being self-aware about your strengths and weaknesses, likes and dislikes. If you are able to have a realistic view of how you respond and react to situations and content, then intrapersonal intelligence is likely to be one of your top ways of processing the world. On the other hand, if you often feel ill prepared respond or struggle to find the right way to react, then this might be an area in which you could build stronger skills.

I really enjoyed this entire process of how you create a painting. The line by line description from start to finish is really effective. It's fun to see the photograph and the sketch and the finished work all in one presentation.
