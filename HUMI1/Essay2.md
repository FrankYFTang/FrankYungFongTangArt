Rubalcaba, Jill, and I. M. Pei. "Architect of Time Place and Purpose." Skyscape (2011).

* Pei was born in the Year of the Fire Snake (1).
* Pei’s older sister is Yuen Hua. Pei’s younger sister is Wei. He had two brothers, Yu Kun and Yu Tsung (2).
* Pei, as a young child, and his family had to flee Suzhou in disguise after his father, Tsuyee Pei, refused to negotiate with the local militia, resulting in an arrest order (2).
* Pei grew up in Hong Kong (3).
* Pei’s mother died of cancer when he was only thirteen years old (4).
* Pei decided to become an architect after watching the Park Hotel, the tallest building in the Far East at the time, being constructed in Shanghai (4).
* Pei’s father was a successful banker. But he was emotionally distant and not physically affectionate. Pei’s father remarried after the death of Pei’s mom. Then sent Pei and his siblings to live in a separate apartment (3).
* Pei spent his summers at his family's ancestral retreat, the Garden of the Lion Forest. Pei’s grandfather taught him traditional Confucian values there (5).
* The design philosophy of Chinese gardens and the carefully placed rock sculptures influenced Pei’s architectural approach (7).
* Pei came to the United States in August 1935 to study architecture at the University of Pennsylvania (8).
* Pei switched to engineering at MIT (8).
* At MIT, Pei discovered the works of modernist architect Le Corbusier (10).
* Pei considered Le Corbusier's two-day lecture at MIT in November 1935 "the most important days in my architectural education" (12).
* Pei earned a master's degree from Harvard's Graduate School of Design. He studied under Walter Gropius, the founder of Germany's influential Bauhaus school (12).
* Pei disagreed with Gropius's anti-historical view that the past had no place in modern architecture (13).
* Pei met Eileen Loo at Grand Central Station while she studied at Wellesley College. Pei and Loo married five days after her graduation (12).
* During World War II, Pei took a leave of absence from Harvard to work on a project finding new ways to destroy buildings (13).
* Pei and his wife Eileen became American citizens on November 11, 1955, at a ceremony in New York City's Polo Grounds (17).
* In 1948, Pei began working for the real estate tycoon William Zeckendorf (15).
* Pei and Zeckendorf had completely opposite personalities. Pei was quiet and refined. Zeckendorf was loud and boisterous (16).
* Pei’s innovative design for Denver's Mile High Center was a huge financial success. It featured a park-like ground level with fountains and heated pavement (18).
* Pei designed and built a family getaway home in the rural town of Katonah, New York (20).
* Pei used prefabricated sections arranged like Chinese temples, which allowed the main structure to be erected in a single day, on his Katonah house. This approach keeps costs down (20). 
* Pei’s Katonah home featured sliding walls that opened onto a screened deck and children's beds on rollers that could be moved outside on summer nights (21).Pei spent a decade working for developer William Zeckendorf. His work was focusing on large-scale, low-cost housing and urban redevelopment projects across North America (21).
* Pei yearned for the opportunity to design public buildings like museums and concert halls (21).
* Pei established his own architectural firm, initially named I. M. Pei & Associates, in 1960 after Zeckendorf's real estate business went bankrupt (21).
* Pei's first major project as head of his own firm was the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, commissioned by astronomer Walter Orr Roberts (23).
* The design for the NCAR building was inspired by the centuries-old Pueblo honeycombed cliff dwellings at Mesa Verde National Park (25).
* For NCAR, Pei crushed local stone and mixed it into the concrete to give the building the same pink tones as the surrounding mountains, allowing it to blend with the landscape (26).
* Pei won the prestigious commission to design the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in 1964 after impressing Jacqueline Kennedy (31).
* During the Kennedy Library project, Pei developed a lifelong friendship with Jacqueline Kennedy, who felt he was "so full of promise, like Jack" (31).
* Pei considered the location for the National Gallery of Art's East Building, on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., to be "the most sensitive site in the United States." (38).
* The "aha moment" for the East Building's design came when he sketched its two-triangle concept on the back of an envelope during a flight (38).
* After nearly 40 years away, Pei was able to return to his homeland in the 1970s following the thaw in US-China relations known as "Ping-Pong Diplomacy" (44).
* Pei repeatedly refused to build modern high-rises near Beijing's Forbidden City (46).
* Pei designed the Fragrant Hill Hotel outside Beijing with the goal of creating a modern architectural language for China that was neither a copy of imperial styles nor a wholesale adoption of Western modernism (47).
