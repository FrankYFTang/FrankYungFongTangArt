Small Meatball Cook with Chinese cabbage and Fried Gluten Balls

I cooked for 30 De Anza students who come to our weekly Bible study my wife and I are hosting at my home. Last week I cooked two dishes for them, Baked Miso Chicken and Small Meatball Cook with Chinese cabbage and Fried Gluten Balls. Below is how I prepare the recipe for the later one.

I purchased 6 lbs of ground pork, 4 balls of garlic, one large Chinese cabbage and two bags of fried gluten balls, and dry mushroom from Ranch 99 Chinese supermarket.

First we need to make the meatball. I mince the garlic and use a food mixer to mix ground pork with the minced garlic. To make the meatball taste good, we need to put in a lot of garlic. I also put in two eggs, some white pepper powder, salt, and rice wine. Then I form them into small balls and deep fry them in oil to stabilize their shape. Since this is a labor intensive process, I make them the night before and put them into refrigerator.

I then need to soak and rehydrate the dry mushroom and fried gluten balls. For better preservation, these items often sell in dehydrated form. The next is to wash the Chinese cabbage and cut them into small pieces. I cook the Chinese cabbage in Chicken stock then I put in the fried gluten balls and mushroom. 

One hour before serving the dinner, I mixed all the items together and heated them up with some final touch. I added oyster sauce and used cornstarch to ticking the sauce and put them into slowcooking pot so the food is hot when the students taste them.

Below are some photos I took during last week’s cooking.

The ability to use your body and movement to convey information is a fundamental part of this intelligence. Some people appear to have a natural ability in this area and excel in physical performance as an athlete or a dancer. But there are lots of other ways that we use movement and gestures to convey information. It's not just about whole body movement but also the parts of us that we use to communicate.

It sounds like you have wonderful community events - it's nice to feed everyone.
