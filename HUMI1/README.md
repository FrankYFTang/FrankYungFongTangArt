## Essay
* Essay - Select a research subject!
  * IM Pei
  * Feedback: This is a wonderful choice and I look forward to reading your project! There are several really wonderful documentaries about I.M. Pei. The one that stands out on my memory showcased his design of the Miho Museum in Japan. It would be fairly old now, but you might look on YouTube, if you haven't already seen it.
