The creative spark IMAGING is defined in the course material as “The process of visualizing mental images which translate into other mediums such as words, music, movements, models, paintings, diagrams, films, sculptures, etc”. 

In the second half of our October 30 Thursday night Chinese Bible study, we utilize this imaging tool. After I used the propositional phrase alignment described in last week’s forum to help the participants to understand there is only one subject , one verb and one idea in that long genealogy, I divided our Bible study into five small groups. I gave each group some art supplies and asked them to illustrate that passage into a collage poster within 15 minutes. Below are these five collage posters they created. This process helps us to imagine the essence of the Biblical message into something memorable. 

The usage of imaging in the spread of religious faith surely involves intersection of fundamental beliefs and values. Basically there are three different kinds of attitudes in religion about the use of images. The first kind uses the artwork as the subject of worship, for example Hinduists or Buddhists treat the artworks they created as sacred and worship them as divine representation. The second kind, Christian in all denominations, prohibits the worship toward the artworks but many of them utilize the artworks as a teaching tool to illustrate the narrative of their religious story. The third kind, in particular Muslin, strictly prohibits the use of images of living beings in any religious context, regardless of worshiping toward or using them as teaching tools for any illustration. We clearly see the fundamental beliefs and values impact the use of imaging. For Muslim artists, due to their belief and value system, they redirect their artistic talent to render vegetation patterns or calligraphy.

Dear Carlos:

 

The LEGO I played 50 years ago while I was a kid is very different from the LEGO the kids played today. Both are very good but I remember the system provides a very primitive building block, forcing the players to utilize their imagination to use very basic building blocks to create new things. Somehow LEGO changed a lot and added many more customized shapes. I feel there are too many advanced components in the system and remove the simplicity now. I love your mention of LEGO but I think we have learned from their advancement and consider a moderate approach to expand.

Regards,

Frank

Dear Alisha 

Thank you for sharing the creative talent of observing. I believe observing is the one of the most important tools to learn. Your mention of Jane Goodall is very good. It is interesting that she observed chimpanzees. I believe what makes her successful is her dedication to a subject and sticking with her subject for a very long time. I believe it is essential that our observations require time. A short period of observation may lead to bias. Time will be the necessary component of observing. 

 

Regards,

Frank

Dear Jeffrey 

Thank you for your sharing of observations. I somehow never connect observing, a visual activity, to the learning of music. I assume learning when to breathe is important when playing musical instruments. I probably should spend more time observing next time I join the choir. 

 

Regards,

Frank


## Feedback
Thanks for sharing your example!

The intersection of fundamental beliefs and values is often a source of creative nourishment for people. Because we care about something, we find ways to improve or support the ideas or activities associated with that thing. These might be small examples that only impact us as individuals or they might be enormous examples with consequences on a global scale. The things which matter to us form the core ideology of our mindset, morals, and ethics. These elements grow and change with us as we mature, developing into increasingly complex outlooks. The way that creativity can be used to connect what we believe with actions or practices can be very powerful.

I have enjoyed this exploration of techniques in your bible study group.
