## Feedback
Thanks for submitting your finished essay!

Learning about an individual is really an exploration of many small details which make up a more complex whole. One of the reasons we approached this assignment step-by-step was to reflect on how many facets go into creating a fully developed biography of any person. It's also a great practice for honing your research skills and practicing how to best organize the raw material into a coherent narrative. You'll write lots of essays and papers in college - one of the best skills that you learn from that process is how to synopsize information, verify your point of view, and provide critical analysis of content. There's so much more value to learning how to write a good paper then just sharing the information that you've learned.

I enjoyed reading about your research! Thanks for including the wonderful images at the end. I was trying to remember if he was also credited with having developed an improved recipe for concrete? I think I recall reading something about that and it changed the way modern construction is done. Such a long life of amazing accomplishments. Excellent paper. I thoroughly enjoy reading your assignments and hope the rest of your journey is enjoyable!
