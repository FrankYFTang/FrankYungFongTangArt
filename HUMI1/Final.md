I plan to utilize my personal creativity to render more portraits for my friends and pastor and increase the number of Asian faces in US art museums. I made a video, titled “
Put More Paintings of Asians into MuseumsLinks to an external site.

”,  to discuss this year and got accepted into the Red Wheelbarrow Student Edition, 2025Links to an external site. as one of the three videos in “2025 Video Showcase”. During the 2025 Spring quarter, I took ARTS 3TE and designed my exhibition and created a video “

” to present such a design. I have already exhibited three of my works at 2024 De Anza Student Art ShowLinks to an external site., three of my works at 2025 De Anza Student Art ShowLinks to an external site. and 34 of my artworks at the 2025 Foothill College Student Art ExhibitionLinks to an external site.. I also made a 3D webpageLinks to an external site. to illustrate the design. So far, I have painted four 4ft x 5ft paintings already.

When I visit many art museums in the United States, I seldom see normal Asian faces in the painting. If I saw one, it is a rendering of a suffering poor Asian. I do not think that is a fair representation of Asians. I want to put more Asian faces into a US art museum, just rendering a normal modern Asian face, not in a stereotypical condition. I am currently learning painting in Foothill College and I believe if I paint more big portraits I will be able to change the world to view Asian people the same way they view other European characters inside the artworld.

Dear Darren

I appreciate you pointing out the issue of the homeless population in California and your heart to serve them by having conversation with them or speak for them. 

I do, however, would like to point out a dilemma about the issue. Several years ago one government worker in this area came to my home to have lunch with us, since she is a friend of my son. She told us one of the problems is the better a homeless service a town provides, the more the homeless people will show up. This is because the homeless population will move toward a town which is more friendly to them. For example, if there are two towns next to each other. One town provides free food and bathroom for the homeless, but another has less available to them, then the homeless in one town are likely to migrate to the town which treats the homeless better. And that spread the word among the homeless population. So it now became a deadlock. The more resources the local government put into serving the homeless, the better care they receive, and that attracts more to migrate to from neighboring towns, and the population grows higher. People will move to places that are easier to survive so they move. And that became a black hole for the local government to deal with, because the more the resources they place in, the bigger the problem. The solution attracts more problems! The fulfillment attracts more demands! 

I think this is a hard problem. So… when we hear the size of the homeless population in an area, we have to be careful about how to interpret the number. A town has more homeless people because they provide better benefits or life support for the homeless than their neighboring towns.
