Body Thinking is a wonderful way to study and understand the issues deeper. It activates the full potential of a person, moving the concept forming from the brain to the rest of the human being. While a person engages the thinking process through the whole body, it pushes the exploration from the head to a person’s heart and strength. 

 

Last Thursday, I led a group of 30 De Anza students in our weekly Chinese Bible study to examine the text of Gospel of Luke chapter 2. That Biblical passage is a narrative about the birth of Jesus Christ in Bethlehem. Since most of the attendees are not Christian, I employ the Bible Study method of Dramatic Play. I divide the large group into five small groups, and ask each group to play out the Biblical narrative. I first asked each group to read the text and identify the characters in the text, and objects appeared in the part they are responsible for. Then I asked them to report to the big group and assign each character to one of the team members, with one member acting as the narrator, who read the Bible text. Then I gave each group fifteen minutes to rehearse their part. One group decided to use my dog Buddy as the lamb in the story, which I think is the most creative part. Then each group acted out their part, one by one. After that, we all vote for the best actor/actress for the role of Joseph, Mary, Jesus, Angel and narrator from the play of different groups. Eventually, we played a Jeopardy game about the fact discovered from that passage. I believe this Bible study method is very creative and allows each attendee to understand the Bible text much deeper than just read out the text. 

Playfulness and Absorption personality play an important role in the Body Thinking process. In my Bible study example, Body Thinking utilizes playfulness from each member and enhances their absorption personality.

Dear Aashi:

I appreciate your choice of Body Thinking as a creative tool. I chose the same topic this week. But I think you approach it with a different aspect than the one I wrote. It is wonderful you mention how “a quiet walk outside” helps you create. I tried to walk my dog at De Anza campus every morning to pray for the group of Chinese students to come to our weekly Thursday Bible study. When I walk on the campus and move around, I can sense my commitment to the ministry increase and more engage with the student body on campus. Then I pray for myself, to have a pure heart to serve my LORD and the students. I then pray for each student one by one and often write a simple message to them with some Bible verses. Walking on campus truly helps me to write some creative blessing to them every morning. Therefore, I 100% agree with your point that “Feeling the fresh breeze against your skin and taking in the nature helps calm my brain. “

Dear Ariana:

I think your definition of Abstracting as “stripping away unnecessary details to reveal the core essence of an idea, object, or experience” is a great one. However, I do not think your example of the design of the iPhone really matches. I think that is a good example of simplification but simplification is not the same as abstracting. The simplification process probably needs to include a step of abstracting but I believe simplification requires more than abstracting.

Dear Sofiya:

Your discussion about playing is a great one. I think playing sometimes is framed inside a certain simplified world, such as some board games which remove some complex details of our life but keep the essential information in the game to play. I appreciate your mention of lowering risk during the playing and I think that truly is an important property of creativity. I found we often refrain from being creative, but instead, take a more conservative approach to the status quo because we fear the consequence of failing. And playing truly helps us to be creative inside a safer world than in the real world.
## Feedback
Thanks for sharing your example!

Each of the creative sparks explored in these discussions should be considered in light of the larger topic under study. This week's topic explores the creative personality. Exactly how we identify who is a creative person tends to get bogged down in definitions and complicated by ideas that may not even be true (review popular creativity myths). Entire courses discuss creative people and explore creativity - our interests are more about how creativity is expressed in our lives. Every person engages in creative outlets and activities on a regular basis but taking that collective experience and formulating a description of a creative personality is daunting!  

I love that you utilized this idea in your weekly meeting. When I was working on my teaching credential we did exercises where each student presented an idea or concept in a language no one else in the room understand. Along with the vocal presentation it was essential to act out using the body to demonstrate as well. It was hilarious and astonishingly successful. There are so many things we communicate with our bodies and gestures rather than our words!
