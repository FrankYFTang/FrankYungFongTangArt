## Submission
The survey identified my top three intelligences as

* Logic/math 4.71
* Self 3.71
* Musical 3.43
 
And list the following scores for others

* Social 3.14
* Spatial 2.86
* Language  2.57
* Nature 2.14
* Body 1.43
 
I agree with the result that lists logic/math, self and musical as the top three from the list they designed into the survey. However, I think the scope of the survey is rather limited and misses many other important aspects of human life. For example, I personally believe my top talent is cooking, which requires a good strength of smell and taste, as well as the knowledge of edible ingredients. Traditionally, sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing are identified as the five human senses. The questions in the survey only focus on activities associated with three of them- sight, touch, and hearing but totally ignore the other two. Because of this, this survey paints an illustration which is biased toward only a subset of human intelligencies. Chefs, coffee baristas, cheesemakers, perfumers, winemakers, viticulturists, vignerons, and anyone else who are talented by their strength in their sense of smell or taste will therefore be miscategorized by this process since their strongest talents are totally ignored by the survey designers. Therefore, I conclude this survey is highly misleading. 

The lowest strength identified by the survey- body, is correctly identified and not a surprise to me. The category “self” is an interesting strength that surprises me, not because it is listed as one of my strengths but rather by the definition of such a concept as a strength. I was always told by my family that I lack a sense of other’s emotion or feeling and the concept of “self” is always labeled as a weakness instead of a strength. The fact is I am not unaware of others’ emotions or feelings but I choose to ignore them. And the reason of such decision is not because I am not compassion but rather philosophically I believe react to unspoken emotions or feelings I sense from others is a form of violating their boundary- I believe if they choose not to speak out or act out what they feel, I have no right to guess what they hide inside their mind. I believe doing so will violate their basic right to control their own words and body movements. Therefore, I do not respond to other’s inner emotions because I choose not to, to respect their boundaries, and their choice of words. I personally believe the ability to ignore is an equal strength of sensing other’s emotions.

Overall, I feel the survey is formed with good intent and creative concepts but requires revision to fill some big gaps. I also wonder how the survey designer evaluates the quality of their design and how they measure the accuracy of their survey report.
## Feedback
Thanks for sharing your assessment results and summarizing your conclusions.

Sometimes we can be surprised by what we thought we knew about ourselves. While most people are aware of the things in which they excel and the things where perhaps they struggle, it's the middle range which can be surprising. One of the fun aspects of exploring multiple intelligences is focusing on each one and really evaluating what it reflects about our abilities.

Great work!

I do think it's important to take assessments like this with a grain of salt. There are so many additional factors that contribute to our success with skills and abilities that simple quizzes like these are really just a starting point to understand much more complex information. In the coming weeks we will look at multiple intelligences individually and explore activities that help refine where each one may fall on the spectrum of capability.
