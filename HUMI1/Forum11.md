The EMPATHIZING creative spark in the course material as “The process of viewing the world through another person’s eyes. Play-act. Familiarize yourself with your subject. Become the thing you wish to understand.”

One great example of empathing is Hung Liu’s self-portrait 1988 work, Resident Alien (Isbister). I first encountered this painting in the San José Museum of Art. In this artwork, Liu renders herself in a giant “greencard” and uses the last name “Cookie” and “Fortune” as first names to form a fake name “Fortune Cookie” (Ch’ien). As Ch’ien described: ““Fortune cookie” is also a pejorative racist slur objectifying Chinese women Liu heard and then turned into a symbol of existing between cultures”.

Notice in the work, Liu uses 020784 as the date of birth. 1984 was the year Liu immigrated to the United States and began her new life. February 7 is her real birthday. This alternation is a way for her to declare her rebirth in her free life in the United State of America. 

On the other hand, the word “ALIEN” on the upper right pokes the eyes of the viewers to force us to think about how we consider our foreign neighbors that work with us and live next to us for a long period of time. Do we consider them as aliens? Or as our neighbors?

By illustrating a giant permanent resident card with her own image on it, Liu invites the viewers to view the world through her identity to criticize the subtle racism hidden under our naturalization service process. 

This work also serves as a great example of how artists utilize empathing as a tool of  activism. Liu “paid tribute to hundreds of marginalized individuals through her practice of expanding upon photographic imagery to create complex paintings” (“Hung Liu”). Liu connects the viewers through these images to simulate their sympathy toward the immigrants and marginalized.

Dear Daaron

I believe in the ancient time, there is always an art for a war because the winner want to celebrate his success and reinforce their rulling power. I don't think those art came from war are always for the reason of activism, but rather, most of time in the ancient, a political propaganda tool. Consider the "I Want You For U.S. Army" poster art" or many artwork dipicting the wining heros. They are all paid to illustrate an positive and higher image of the ruler

Dear Sofiya 

Thank you for sharing the two stereoscopic images. But I have a hard time to understand how does that connect to the issue of "Creativity in Activism" ? 
## Feedback
Thanks for sharing your example!

Finding ways to infuse creativity in our activism is a practical way to create awareness and bring about change. It doesn't have to be the monumental global scale efforts that we'd like to see because often that's not something we are capable of tackling. It can be something simple and effective and efficient which you can take on as an individual. The power of collective change is what makes activism possible. There are instances of this illustrated in history but all we have to do is look at the examples students have shared all quarter long about the myriad of ways creativity has inspired them to take action. Even young children become aware that a single thought, a simple act, or a momentary decision can be all that it takes to change the course of events - they may not be able to articulate that process but they are aware of it! Likewise, you do not have to be able to articulate all the facets of your choices and decisions which are actively mapping out your future - you simply have to keep putting one step in front of the other. I hope that you will keep exploring your creativity as you go!
