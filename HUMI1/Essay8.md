IM Pei’s most famous creative contributions are the architecture designs of the following projects:

* Louvre Pyramid (Le Grand Louvre) at Paris, France (1989): Challenge the traditional architecture in French culture but mixing Egyptian Pyramid shape in transparent glass. His work revolutionized the concept of tradition and aesthetics and extended the beauty of the Louvre to a different level.
* East Building, National Gallery of Art at Washington, DC, USA (1978): Build the museum in the most optimized way to use the land and consider what the visitors need. 
* Bank of China Tower at Hong Kong (1989): He utilized the limited real estate space and the constraints of the shape of the land and built a symbolic work with limited resources.
* Museum of Islamic Art at Doha, Qatar (2008): Pei abstracted the essence of islamic art and built a contemporary Islamic museum beyond the traditional concept of Islamic art. 
* John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum at Boston, USA (1979): He broke through all the landscape challenges and foundation problems to build a great presidential library with the support from Kenndy’s widow. 
* Mesa Laboratory, National Center for Atmospheric Research at Boulder, Colorado, USA (1967).
* Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at Cleveland, Ohio, USA (1995).
* Suzhou Museum at Suzhou, China (2006): He borrowed the traditional Chinese concept of Suzhou township to build a new museum fit into this ancient city.

Great work!

Identifying the creative contributions of your research subject focuses on the criteria which illustrates why they are perceived as influential in their field. Every individual is going to demonstrate creative achievements in some fashion but the ones which impact how the rest of us follow-through when we go a similar route are the folks with big-C creativity. The solutions they create, the discoveries they make, and the paths they trail blaze lead the way for the rest of us. Revealing how the creativity of an individual and illustrating how their achievements influence the world, can help others recognize their own potential!

As I read down your list, it made me realize just how international the legacy of his work encompasses. I'm most familiar with only a handful of his architectural works, so I'm interested to read your final paper.
