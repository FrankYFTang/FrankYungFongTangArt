Dimensional Thinking is a process to “map or alter the proportions of an object from 2-D to 3-D, or the reverse”. Therefore, it is a process of transformation. One such example is the collection of photos I took of many heads of sculptures. 

I am a two dimensional artist, not a three dimensional one but I also appreciate the artworks from three dimensional artists. Therefore, I often take photos of the sculptures I saw in a museum. My creative part kicks in when I decide the angle and distance I took these photos ( https://photos.app.goo.gl/npf9xU1LftSguCEq7Links to an external site. ). 

Here is one example, I took a photo of the famous sculpture of Auguste Rodin - Thinker from the Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University. The image I created in the photograph not only captures his work, but also frames it by the background ceiling designed by the architecture. I think this is a good example of Dimensional Thinking because the Thinker is designed by Rodin but the two dimensional projection of his work is by me. 

In other words, in Dimensional Thinking, we take a pre-existing concept or object, fix it into a specific context with additional constraints, to direct the focus to a specific area of observation or view point. The surrounding context frames the original idea into a more specific environment and recreates a new work.  

This reframing processing is an example of a specific shaping of creative behavior. This behavior is appropriate pre-existing master piece, mixed with additional works, to level it up to a different skyline. By filming the head of the Thinker in this specific angle and distance, I use the pillars and the ceiling of the Rotunda in Diekman Gallery to form the halo for him. The foreshortening of his hands and the overlapping which block the viewing of the lower part of his face force the viewer to think about what he is thinking.

Dear Keity:

Your example of how aerospace engineers use model airplanes in wind tunnels is great. I would like to point out in that example, not only the airplane itself could be a model plane, the wind tunnel itself is also a simplified model of the atmosphere in a controlled environment. And some wind tunnels are very large to house real 1:1 size airplanes. Therefore, the airplane may not be scaled but the controlled airflow might be.

 

Regards,

Frank

Dear Arsalan:

 

Thanks for discussing the creative Analogizing. This is the first time I hear about how Steve Jobs compares the computer to a “bicycle for the mind”. I found it was recently mentioned by Agrawal et al. I also found a video of Steve Jobs talking about that.

. Very interesting. I think that is a wonderful example. However, I think the meme you use of showing that four person on a strange design Bicycle is not a good example for that.

Dear Deyanira 

 

Thank you for discussing Empathizing this week. I always feel I lack this skill. Also, I sometimes have a bad feeling about other people attempting to empathize with me. The reason is I felt they cross the boundary of my internal and external boundary. For example, a lot of the time, my wife will sense my impatience in my heart which I have not yet verbalized. From my point of view, if I controlled myself to not speak out what I feel inside, then I should be considering not having those or responsible for those feelings, since that is INSIDE my mind. However, my wife often “empathizes” my feelings (correctly) and blames me for what I have felt inside but controlled myself and not yet speak out. I feel very unhappy about such interaction. From my point of view, people who have the power of empathizing too often misuse their ability and blame someone for some thinking they controlled and not yet act out. Therefore, I feel the creativity of empathizing is very dangerous, because it intrudes into people’s inner world and asks people to be responsible for something they cannot control (what they think), versus what they can control (their outer action).
## Feedback
Thanks for sharing your example!

This week's topic explores creative behavior and the creative sparks used to explore connections between the topic and our personal practices cover a lot of ground. Even the idea of what constitutes a creative behavior can be expansive! Casual research about this subject reveals a lot of different themes about how it is defined. Whichever approach you take, there is likely to be another person who views the possibilities of that creative spark from a different angle, and that’s what makes creative behaviors so important - that diversity of approaches, ideas, practices, and definitions produce a tapestry of results.

Oh. what a neat way to reframe the way we view sculpture! I really enjoy the Rodin looking up past the hand and the ceiling providing the halo. It makes me think about how the framing we bring to viewing makes a difference in how we perceive a work, regardless of what the artist might have intended.
