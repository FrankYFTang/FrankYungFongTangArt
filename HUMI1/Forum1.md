Part 1 Introduction

My name is 譚永鋒 or Tang Yung-Fong . Tang is my family name and you can just call me Frank Tang. My emoji name is 🌭🍊 because Hot Dog is Frank (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_dogLinks to an external site. ) and orange is Tangerine . 

I am a software engineer in my daytime job for the last 32 years. Just work for Google more than 20 years  (  https://www.linkedin.com/in/frank-yung-fong-tang-8489a4Links to an external site. ). Right now, I am studing Art History and Painting in De Anza college and Foothill college concurrently. 

I was born in Taipei Taiwan. I never attened highschool. After my middle school, I studied in a five years junior engineering college and got my college diploma in EE (similar to AS degree) from Minghsin University of Science and Technology in 1987. I do not have any bachelor degrees but I do have two master degrees: I got my MS in Computer Science degree from Northeastern University Boston in 1993, Master in Data Science degree from UC Berkeley 2022. I also got my AA in Liberal Art from De Anza College in 2023 and  AA in Art History from De Anza College in 2024. Beside that I also took courses under non degree program from SJSU, UCSC Extension, Georgetown, George Mason, and Stanford. I have transcripts from ten universities/colleges. But I never have a bachelor degree :) Strange! right?

In my free time, I play a video game called "canvas", produced by De Anza College and Foothill College, every week the game will issue some challenges for me to solve and if I complete them correctly for 12 weeks, I got an A or A+.

I also cook for a lot of friends. Every Thursday night I gather 15-25 Chinese speaking students in the Fellowship of Overseas Students from De Anza college to my home to eat dinner and study Bible in Chinese. This year, we will study the book of Luke. You can view our previous activities from https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuNDlBSLzrDhYJ8lmyKM_6BPGHugZfIS5&si=xuDgG2Ed1yDb4FLy . I love to cook for them and lead the Bible study with my wife, Christine, together. 

I also love to paint. I am considering applying for MFA at Stanford for Fall 2027. To prepare for my application, I am building up my "big portrait" painting portfolio now. Below are four 48x60 Arcylic portraits I painted so far. Some of you may see the first one at Euphrat Museum of Art in the De Anza Student Art Show 2025 during May 2025 ( https://photos.app.goo.gl/Bvi1XyZk61cpdBxY9Links to an external site. ) or from the Red Wheelbarrow Student Edition, 2025 ( https://www.deanza.edu/english/creative-writing/documents/2025-Red-Wheelbarrow-Student-Edition.pdf#page=71Links to an external site.)

Part 2 One way creativity addresses basic human needs, meaning, or personal fulfillment

In my daily life, I exercise my creativity mainly in four different kinds of activities- software development, cooking, painting, and poem writing.

 

Software Development: As a software engineer working in the Silicon Valley for more than 30 years, I work on creativity daily in my job. Software development is often a balance between feature, cost, time, memory usage, and quality. Therefore, software engineers need to craft creative solutions by using computer languages to express their creative solution. Oftentimes, the most creative solution uses very short expression and less memory to achieve high quality very quickly and non creative solutions waste cost and time. While people often consider Software Development to be an engineering work, the most clever solutions are often highly artistic. The creativity in Software Development requires carefully understanding the problem and exploring various possible solutions, and most importantly, recognize the changing context of our environment. Very frequently, a great solution comes out at the right time, and not achievable before its time, simply because the surrounding supporting economic environment is not mature, or cost effective, for that before. 

 

Cooking: In my personal life, I enjoy creativity in my daily cooking. I combine different kinds of hot pepper to create a very rich level of hot dishes to serve my friends. Cooking good food often requires me to put different fresh ingredients together and explore new techniques. It not only fulfills the very basic human need of hunger and seeking for satisfaction, but also very meaningful as a way to show my love to the one I serve my food. Nothing is more satisfying after seeing my fellow students finish my food and pack all the leftovers home after dinner.

 

Portrait Painting: I painted many portraits of my friends to show my love to them. I also paint many self portraits. While my friends and family saw my finished work, they knew how much I loved them. They know I am willing to spend time rendering their faces and praying for them during the work. It became a way for me to express my affection to my friends. Painting self portraits helps me to reexamine my own identity and inner feelings. Seeing my completed works and exhibiting them to others also fulfills my big ego. 

 

Poem Writing: Poem writing helps me to crystallize my memory, good or bad, big or small, joy or sorrow, of a particular moment. I wrote several hundred Chinese poems and archived tem in https://github.com/FrankYFTang/FrankYungFongTangArt/tree/main/ChinesePoemsLinks to an external site. . I also wrote and blogged some English poems in https://github.com/FrankYFTang/FrankYungFongTangArt/blob/main/EnglishReflectionPoems.mdLinks to an external site. . I am very honor that De Anza English department publish one of them, “A Time of Destruction”, in Red Wheelbarrow Student Edition, 2025 ( https://www.deanza.edu/english/creative-writing/documents/2025-Red-Wheelbarrow-Student-Edition.pdf#page=96Links to an external site. ) It is a poem I wrote to memorize the destruction of Flint Center at De Anza college. I believe it is a shared memory for many members of the De Anza college community.

Software development, cooking, painting, and poem writing are all dealing with creativity. These activities explore different kinds of intelligence and I enjoy them all. They fulfill different kinds of needs and are meaningful for me in different aspects. All of them enhance my sense of fulfillment in different frequency and time periods within a week.

Dear Sofiya 

Nice to meet you virtually in this class. One of my friends, Lora, in a Bible study group together in the last five years is also from Belarus. She often made great Belarussian desserts and cooking to share with us in our monthly meeting. I wish one day I can visit this country. 

I have a dog named Buddy. I often walk Buddy in the De Anza campus while praying for my fellow Chinese classmates. Buddy is a SCWT - Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier. 

I think the way you view creativity is from the artistic aspect. I totally agree with you from that aspect creativity is serving the fulfillment of the artists. 

However, that is not the full extent of the creativity. There are other aspects of creativity- a chef exercises their creativity while cooking a meal, and the result of their creativity fulfills basic human needs- resolves hunger. Therefore, creativity could be also viewed from its functional aspect. Most industry designers employ their creativity while solving utility functions and use the result to address physical needs of human beings. These exercises of creativity are not targeted for expression, but to improve utility function or cutting cost. They are also an employment of creativity. 

What do you think?

Regards,

Frank

Dear Darren:

I learn drawing with crayons and gouache when I was young till my third grade. During my middle school I still draw my stepfather by pencil. I was once wanting to study mechnaical engeering or architect because it require the study of technical drawing. However after middle school, I choose to study electronic engineering in junior college because it seems have higher job demand at that time. So I stop. I attempted to draw and paint several times in the next 30 years but it didn't take off. Around 2016, the health of my aging parents, decline quickly and I have to travel to Shanghai China to visit them every seven weeks. Each time, I stay there for 3 days and come back to work. My very old stepfather, 96 years old at that time, can no longer communicate with me via Zoom or telephone so I need to show up in person to love them. In April 2018, after attending a Watercolor workshop hosted by the Visual Arts Ministry at PBCC (Peninsula Bible Church Cupertino) ( see https://pbcc.org/ministry/art/Links to an external site. ) I painted one watercolor and one arcylic portrait of my stepfather in the seven weeks I was not beside him. I gave both paintings to him and he passed away one month later. After that I found painting my loved one and give or show them my work is a love language to express my affection and care of them.

Dear Darren

Thank you so much to bring up cooking food in this discussion. I personally believe cooking is my best talent and it require a lot of creativity, from the selection of ingridients, they way of cutting to create different texture, combining different spices or seasoning to build a multilayer taste. Also, how to place or serve the food is a very creative process. I cook for 15-25 students in my Thursday night Chinese Bible study (part of Fellowship of Overseas Stuents club in De Anza College) in weekly basis. It is surely a regular routine for me to push and channel all my creativity to follow what my God ask me to do- "Jesus answered, “The foremost is, ‘Hear, O Israel! The Lord our God is one Lord; and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ The second is this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”（Mark 12:29-31/NASB）Every Wedneday night I am cooking food to treat my Lord Jesus Christ, because HE said : "The King will answer and say to them, ‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of these brothers of Mine, even the least of them, you did it to Me.’" （Matthew 25:40/NASB). Cooking for my firends before our weekly Bible study therefore is not only a way to show my affection to them, but also the way I choose to worship my God!

 

Regards,

Frank

Dear Arsalan

Good to see a person majoring Computer Science here. It is great that you work on  creative coding projects. In Spring 2025, I took ARTS 3TE Today's Art Scene. The final project ask us to build a 1:10 model for an art exhibition. Therefore I first build a physical Maquette model ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5j6Rg8q784 ) to host the design of my solo exhibition. Then I design my  solo exhibition which consists of a lot of my paintings and photographys and film this video (
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5HBaLu7EIULinks to an external site.

) After that, I decide to also build a virtual 3D web version based on the same design by using JavaScript code and THREE.js You can play with in on computer, but the navigation not yet work on Tablet or Mobile devices ( https://frankyftang.github.io/showroom/Links to an external site.  ). You can find my code at https://github.com/FrankYFTang/showroomLinks to an external site. . I totally agree with you that creativity could solve problems in unique ways. The whole program is just 800 lines of JavaScript code (https://github.com/FrankYFTang/showroom/blob/main/main.jsLinks to an external site. ) utilizing pre-existing software library. Programming language is also a way of artistic expression produced by creativity.

Frank

Welcome to Creative Minds! 

Over the next weeks we will investigate how creativity impacts our lives. This is an interdisciplinary introduction to exploring the study of creativity. We’ll focus on the development of creativity as a central source of meaning and purpose in human life by exploring creative activities and individuals from around the globe. Through analysis of creative outlet, the course builds commitment to civic and moral responsibility in diverse, equitable, healthy and sustainable communities. In the process of looking at creative development, we’ll apply some special emphasis on the use of art as a tool for social change.

We have so much to explore!

I'm happy to see you in class again! I found your explanation for how you missed out on getting a bachelor's degree to be really interesting. Its's fascinating how many different routes to higher education exist in different parts of the world. I hope that you do apply to Stanford university. It would be so exciting to see you move forward with your interest in art. I have thought many times about all of the wonderful photos that you shared in HUMI 16 and I look forward to seeing more of them in this class. I love your big portraits! They remind me a little of the compositions by Chuck Close when he made those large-scale paintings. I fully expect to see your art in a textbook someday!
