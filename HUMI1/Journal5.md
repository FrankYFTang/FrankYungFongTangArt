Thanks for sharing your response! 

 

Visual and spatial intelligence encompass the way that we use imagery to make sense of information. This might be sensory related and occur in two-dimensional or three-dimensional ways. The way we process visual and spatial information can be very personal and subjective.

 

I love the perspective on this. It's fun to do the reverse too - climb to the top of a skyscraper and illustrate the ground. They make fun counterparts to one-another.
