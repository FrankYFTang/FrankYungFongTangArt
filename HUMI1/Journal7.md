## Submission
Below is a record of a brainstorming session and shared inquiry in our weekly Chinese Bible study. This example is recorded in our October 17 2024 Bible study. The passage we examine that night is the second half of chapter 1 in the Gospel of John (John 1:29-51)

In that passage, there are a lot of mentions of “see”. John the Baptist asked his disciple to check out Jesus by saying “Behold, the Lamb of God!” after he “saw Jesus coming to him”. So I asked the group to brainstorm all the English words that are synonyms of “see”. I first divided the large group into four small groups (Black, Blue, Green, Blank) and gave each group three minutes to list all the words they can think about. Then I appointed one student to be the white board recorder of our brain storming and run a race to give each group a chance to say one new word. Amazingly, we listed 54 words in English that we can use to study the life of Jesus:

## Feedback
Thanks for sharing your response! 

Some people are very skilled in their personal interactions, always seeming to know exactly what to say or how to defuse a situation. While anyone can improve their interactions through practice and effort, some individuals just seem to always be in the groove. They help put other people at ease, pull together a group with little effort, and manage to keep everyone on track, even when things are chaotic. Like many of the intelligences we’ve explored, there are different ways each one can be expressed. Even when you are successful in one method - try another and see how it works!

Great example and an effective way to process information. I think teaching any content is an intensive way to learn it too. I think of how many excellent skills your study is learning along with their study of the bible. Impressive!
