FREAK - “I'm a certified freak ten days a week”

     "FREAK" is a song of Yuqi's first mini-album YUQ1 (Seon). The song was released with its music video on April 23, 2024 (Sayson). Yuqi is a member of the South Korean K-POP girl group I-dle, which first debuted as (G)I-dle under Cube Entertainment in 2018. The lyrics of the song were written by the collaboration of four: Yuqi, Audun Agnar Gludbrandsen, Kyle Faulkner, and Jop Pangemanan (“Yuqi - Freak Lyrics.”). 

     The lyric is a narrative about an unnamed female character. The singer called her a “certified freak”. The description is poetically exaggerated. For example, the singer thinks she behaves like a freak “ten days a week”, which ironically is impossible. The writer seems to strongly admire the figure because she “got me crazy” but also “got me weak”. The writer describes her as a “co-star baby”, which is a modern, pop-culture-infused expression of a strong romantic or infatuated connection. It is a direct nod to the Co-Star app, a famous astrology mobile app among Gen Z (Lines). The mention of “Libra”, the seventh astrological sign in the zodiac, in the next line strengthens such a connection. The author also refers to popular Asian terminology- such as “straight out a boba”. Boba milk tea is very popular in Asia, especially within Chinese audiences, where Yuqi came from. So “boba” also implied sweetness (Damayanti). But the author also tries to connect to the western audience, so she mentioned “Drew to my Barrymore” referring to the song "Drew Barrymore” sung by SZA released in 2017 (Koscelnik). 

     There are many repetitions of the line “She's a certified freak. Ten days a week” in the lyrics. These repetition form the main theme of this song. In our modern society we think a week is by definition seven days and seven days only (Zerubavel). However, the French government actually used a calendar system called the French Revolution calendar, which has ten days in a week, between late 1793 to 1805 in France (Shaw). Also, in the Traditional calendar system used in Hawaii, they have a week like ten days period called “anahulu” (Schmitt). We are not sure if the author is referring to these two concepts in history or just simply an ironic expression as a synonym of “out of norm”.

     Another interesting observation about this song is the mention of car makers: “We don't need no Benz”, “She rides the moto like Mercedes”, and “Gonna test drive like a Honda Civic”. These vehicles function as metaphors in the song. I believe both Benz and Mercedes present high class and wealth while Honda Civic is a symbol for “fast” and “speed”, mentioned in the next line. 

     The turning point of the song come close to the following two lines: “I've been on a throne Did you know that I'm a queen?” then the singer delivered the shocking truth “But little did I know that she's really me?” 

     Yes, she is not singing about another person! She is singing about herself, from a third person’s angle to introduce herself to others as a “certified freak”. Now, after we listen to her singing till almost the end, she told us the truth- She is talking about herself “I'm a certified freak”. She is simply a narcissist - the way of her own move got herself crazy and weak! She felt “I'm a certified freak Ten days a week”. She finally admits she is the person described in the narrative. It is not a different person, but herself only. 

      Overall, I think this is a catchy song. I enjoy the melody and the song is not too hard to sing. I think the turning at the end of the song is really interesting.

She's a certified freak

Ten days a week

The way she's movin' got me crazy, got me weak

She's a co-star baby

Libra got me loca crazy

And she straight out a boba, yeah

So you know how she is? 

And everybody knows

And oh, she got that thing that I'm lookin' for

Drew to my Barrymore

I'ma go to tell all my friends

She's a certified freak

Ten days a week 

The way she's movin' got me crazy, got me weak

She's a certified freak

I'm on my knees  

The way she's lookin' like a movie, baby, please

The way she's movin' got me crazy

Freakin' on the daily

We don't need no Benz

She rides the moto like Mercedes

She's the only reason to make you stay this weekend

Go nowhere to be, you bring the mood

I'll bring the way now

 

And oh, she got that thing that I'm lookin' for

Drew to my Barrymore

Stop, hold up, wait a minute 

Everybody knows that she gets freaky with it  

Gonna test drive like a Honda Civic 

Fell in love too fast, got a speeding ticket, hoo  

You get me higher

Look in the mirror, I see a fire

Baby, I'm dreaming seeing you

Making me speechless  

Loving the way you smile

Yeah, everybody wants a little piece

I've been on a throne

Did you know that I'm a queen?  

Keeping it on the low

But little did I know that she's really me? 

I'm a certified freak

Ten days a week  

The way she's movin', got me crazy got me weak

I'm a certified freak  

I'm on my knees 

The way she's looking like a movie, baby, please

I'm a certified freak 

Certified freak  

I'm a certified freak 

Certified freak 

I'm a certified

The process of analyzing song lyrics often reveals that meaning is multifaceted. There’s usually the obvious intention of the song but some lyrics also tell stories. Even when a song has just repetitive sequences of sound punctuated with vocalizations and words, there may be underlying patterns. Some song lyrics cross generations because they speak to shared experiences while others are aimed at smaller audiences. It’s fun to explore music and songs from unfamiliar sources for exactly that reason!
