You’ve found some great details for your essay!

Vital statistics provide details such as birth and death dates, locations where an individual resided during their lifetime, if they were married, and if they had children. Other details are often incorporated with this information, including educational background, achievements and awards, and even contributions to a discipline. Vital statistics are used to provide a more comprehensive picture of an overall population when data is aggregated. For our purposes in writing an essay, we are interested in how that information may expand or illustrate connections found in the course of research. This provides a more emotional texture to a person's life, and often makes them more relatable to the reader.

What a wonderful long life.
