Dear Keity

Thank you for sharing your excellent in-depth analysis about empathizing. I learn a lot from the information you provided about the “A Mile in My Shoes” exhibit in the Empathy Museum. I think it is a wonderful idea to use that object lesson to empower everyone to experience the unique challenges in different roles and professions in this diverse society. The idea clearly is associated with the English idiom “walk a mile in (someone's) shoes”, as defined in The Free Dictionary by Farlex: “To spend time trying to consider or understand another person's perspectives, experiences, or motivations before making a judgment about them” (“Walk a Mile”). The exhibit takes that idiom literally to implement such object lessons for everyone. I believe traditionally the pain points we may experience from such acts are due to the fact that every person has different sizes of feet and walking a mile in unfitted shoes could be either painful, clunky, or awkward. The designers are very creative to expand such ideas to the shoes of different professions. I think this a wonderful example of how the designers utilize their empathizing intelligences and also promote it. What a wonderful example!

Dear Keven

Thank you for sharing about the observation and connecting that to the story of the invention of Velcro. However, I need to point out a mistake you stated in your essay. You claim it was invented in 1991. However, that is not true. I used Velcro long before 1991. Actually, Velcro was invented in 1948, not 1991 (Yenne 82). In fact, George de Mestral, the inventor of Velcro died in 1990 (Kennedy 51). I totally agree with you observing is an important intelligence and I strongly encourage you to observe the year of invention from the reference material more carefully.

Dear Arsalan:

 

Thank you for sharing about the observation and your discussion of how photographers utilize this important skill. I do think observing plays an important part of how photographers frame their work. I took a lot of photos and my strong observation skills do help me a lot. Two years ago, I traveled to Goblin Valley State Park in central Utah (“Goblin Valley State Park”). I filmed many photos of hoodoos in that, each of them looks like a cartoon character in SuperMario game. My observation skills help me to turn the filming of muddy rocks into interesting  “portrait photos”. You can find more photos I took from that place in https://photos.app.goo.gl/7WXXou6F999dZFGF9Links to an external site.

The intelligences of abstracting is the noun form of the verb abstract. In Merriam-Webster dictionary, the verb “abstract” is defined with the following four meanings: disassociated from any specific instance, expressing a quality apart from an object, dealing with a subject in its abstract aspects, and having only intrinsic form with little or no attempt at pictorial representation or narrative content (“Abstract Definition & Meaning”). One of the famous portrait painters Chuck Close utilized such ability in his wonderful portrait work in his late stage of artist life. Close was a Photo-realistic portrait painter in the early part of his career. However, in 1989 , he suffered from a spinal blood clot paralyzed him to a wheelchair. After that, we see a dramatic change of style in his work. He lost fine control of hand movement and therefore he rendered a grid of cells with several nesting colorful ovoid and elliptical shapes to illustrate the face he painted. The work is a mix of abstraction and realistic image. While we observe the painting in close approximation, all we see are blocks of abstract shapes. However, while observed from a distance, usually more than ten meters away, we can clearly see the figure he painted. Below are some photos I took in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington DC, showing his rendering of President William Clinton (“William J. Clinton”). 

 

Abstraction is usually achieved by one of the two methods- generalization and specialization (Gonzalez-Perez). Generalization is the process to find the common shared characters from collected samples. Specialization is the process of finding the unique features from the collected samples, while the majority of cases have some common features but a handful of edge cases do not. Both processes help us to build up abstract intelligence. During either process, we will enhance our self-awareness by understanding what ourselves is the same or different from a subgroup of subjects we interact with. Therefore, the exercising of abstracting intelligences often links to better self-awareness.

Thanks for sharing your example!

This week we explore different ways of looking at creativity. These creative sparks provide a springboard (hopefully!) to think about how you process information. By linking together information about our personal perspective with topics like emotional intelligence, and applying those ideas to how we perceive information in general, we become more aware of how we learn. The value of thinking about this topic is that it encourages exploration with new methods. For example, I learn most effectively by reading and writing. As a student I took copious notes and then I never looked at them again. It was the process of writing down information that helped transfer those ideas into my long-term memory. Some people find it more successful to talk about information, discussing or explaining it helps transfer that into their memory banks. You may already know what your strengths are - but it never hurts to explore something new because you might discover there's an entirely different way that you can be successful!

I enjoyed the photographs that you took of the hoodies in your travels. You can almost see faces in the stone shapes. I have never seen a close-up of these paintings by Chuck Close. It's an interesting compositional style, almost a macro type of pointillism...
