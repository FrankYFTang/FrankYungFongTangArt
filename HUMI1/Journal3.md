## Submission



This is a UML Class Diagram to illustrate the relationship between different calendar subclasses inside the open source ICU library. I copy it from a presentation slide I crafted 5 years ago (Tang 5).

## Feedback
Thanks for sharing your response! 

 

I think that mathematical and logical intelligence is a topic that most students think about computational math rather than the representation and connecting of information in a visual format. That's part of what makes charts like these so interesting. They convey information that is enhanced with a little bit of additional text.

 

I know there are many different calendrical systems but I've never seen them laid out like this. Very interesting.
