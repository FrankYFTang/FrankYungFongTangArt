The creative spark Transforming is defined in the course material as “the process of transforming ideas from one language of communication into another, using different sets of tools”. In addition, Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines the verb “transform” as: a. to change in composition or structure, b. to change the outward form or appearance of, and c. to change in character or condition.

In our October 30 Thursday night Chinese Bible study, we utilize this transformation tool. We study the text of the Gospel of Luke 3:15-3:38. It is a challenging text to study because it includes a very long line of genealogy of Jesus.

 

It is hard to understand what the Bible said here because due to the linguistic limitation of the Chinese language, the translators who translate the text from Greek to Chinese more than one hundred years ago have to perform a linguistic transformation. The original Greek text of Luke 3:23-38 actually contains only one subject - Jesus, and one idea- Jesus is the son of God. And all other details are just propositional phrases to modify that idea. The original Greek text is

Notice the word “τοῦ” means “(son) of” and all the name only appeared once in the Greek and the whole idea here is to explain the main concept

“Jesus Himself was about thirty years old, being, as was commonly held, 

the son of ….. God”.

 

However, due to the limitation in Chinese, the Chinese Bible transforms them into many sentences, with each sentence having one of the names as the subject and the next as object.

The good news about this translation transformation is it makes this very long sentence readable and comprehensible. The bad news is such transformations actually change the core idea of the original text and introduce non-vital relationships into this text. Once upon a time an Elder in Virginia cited this verse as the proof that “Adam is the son of God”.

 

In order to help our participants to understand this text, I show three slides, one for each language and align the linguistic structure on the slide to show the pattern.

This placement of the word τοῦ / the son of  / 是 … 的兒子 vertically is a form of transformation. 

Through this, I help the students to understand what the original Greek text is stressing about and not get lost in the details. 

In terms of the relationship to the freedom to personal creativity, transformation helps us to utilize a concept difficult to express in one domain to another domain which may be easier to memorize or comprehend. As we can see, Jesus, viewed by many as a child from a plebeian Joseph, now connects through this linguistic structure back to God Himself.

Dear Jalen Williams

Thank you for sharing the poem of Mulan. All students who are educated in Taiwan similar to me have to memorize that poem when we were in high school. Notice most of the lines are five characters per line.

 

唧唧復唧唧，

木蘭當戶織。

不聞機杼聲，

唯聞女歎息。

 

問女何所思，

問女何所憶。

女亦無所思，

女亦無所憶。

 

昨夜見軍帖，

可汗大點兵。

軍書十二卷，

卷卷有爺名。

 

阿爺無大兒，

木蘭無長兄。

願為市鞍馬，

從此替爺征。

 

東市買駿馬，

西市買鞍韉，

南市買轡頭，

北市買長鞭。 

 

旦辭爺娘去，

暮宿黃河邊；

不聞爺娘喚女聲，

但聞黃河流水鳴濺濺。

 

旦辭黃河去，

暮宿黑山頭；

不聞爺娘喚女聲，

但聞 燕山胡騎聲啾啾。 

 

萬里赴戎機，

關山度若飛。

朔氣傳金柝，

寒光照鐵衣。 

 

將軍百戰死，

壯士十年歸。

歸來見天子，

天子坐明堂。

 

策勳十二轉，

賞賜百千彊。

可汗問所欲，

木蘭不用尚書郎，

願借明駝千里足，

送兒還故鄉。

 

爺娘聞女來，

出郭相扶將。

阿姊聞妹來，

當戶理紅妝。 

小弟聞姊來，

磨刀霍霍向豬羊。

開我東閣門，

坐我西閣牀； 

脫我戰時袍，

着我舊時裳；

當窗理雲鬢，

對鏡帖花黃。

出門看火伴，

火伴皆驚惶

同行十二年，

不知木蘭是女郎。

 

雄兔腳撲朔，

雌兔眼迷離；

兩兔傍地走，

安能辨我是雄雌？ 

 

*Chirp, chirp, chirp*,

Mulan weaves at her loom.

No sound of the shuttle is heard,

Only the sighs of the woman.

 

"What are you thinking, woman?

What are you remembering, woman?"

"I am thinking of nothing,

I am remembering nothing."

 

"Last night I saw the conscription notice,

The Khan is raising a large army."

"The military register has twelve scrolls,

Each scroll bears my father's name."

 

"My father has no grown son,

Mulan has no elder brother."

"I wish to buy a saddle and horse,

From now on, I will go to war in my father's place."

 

"In the east market I bought a fine horse,

In the west market I bought a saddle and bridle,

In the south market I bought a bridle,

In the north market I bought a long whip."

 

"At dawn I bid farewell to my parents,

At dusk I camped by the Yellow River;

I heard no sound of my parents calling me,

Only the rushing and splashing of the Yellow River."

 

"At dawn I left the Yellow River,

At dusk I camped at the Black Mountain;

I heard no sound of my parents calling me,

Only the mournful cries of the barbarian cavalry of Yanshan."

 

She traveled ten thousand miles to the battlefield, 

crossing mountains and passes as if flying.

The northern wind carried the sound of the watchman's clapper,

The cold light shone on her iron armor.

 

The general died in a hundred battles,

The brave soldier returned after ten years.

She returned to see the Emperor,

The Emperor sat in the Hall of Brightness.

Her merits were rewarded twelve times,

and she received countless riches.

 

The Khan asked what she desired,

Mulan did not want the position of Minister,

but wished to borrow a swift camel to send her back to her hometown.

Her parents heard of their daughter's return,

and went out of the city to greet her.

Her elder sister heard of her younger sister's return,

and dressed herself in her finest clothes.

Her younger brother heard of his elder sister's return,

and sharpened his knife, ready to slaughter pigs and sheep.

 

She opened the door to her east chamber,

and sat on her bed in the west chamber;

she took off her battle robe,

and put on her old clothes;

 

she combed her hair by the window,

and applied makeup before the mirror.

She went out to see her comrades,

and they were all astonished;

 

They had traveled together for twelve years,

and did not know Mulan was a woman.

The male rabbit's feet twitch, 

the female rabbit's eyes are glazed; 

the two rabbits run side by side, 

how can one tell which is male and which is female?

 

Disney took some part of this poem into their script.

Dear Keven 

Thank you for sharing about Empathizing. One issue I have with Empathing is sometime those who are good in Empathizing may over project their experience into other’s shoes if they do not constrain themself to first clearly understand what other faced. I personally think Empathizing is important but also a double edge sword. It may get us closer to another’s emotion but also may break the boundary and invade into spaces others prefer us not to get into.

Dear Sofiya 

Thank you for the sharing of modeling and connecting that to 3D rendering. During 1990, one of the key computer graphics research academics was the architect department of Carnegie Mellon University. They utilize the ray tracing algorithm and develop architecture 3D rendering to help them show to their customer about the architect they design. That helps them to lower their cost to express their idea. Before the availability of computer three dimensional rendering software, they have to find artist to draw many pictures to allow their customers to know and feel about the impact of their design.



## Feedback
Thanks for sharing your example!

Freedom to explore creative expression at a personal level is essential to conveying how we see the world. Everyone has probably experienced that moment when you've looked at something, or heard something, and not comprehended the meaning. I still remember my first visit to a modern art museum and standing in front of a display of this highly acclaimed work and not understanding why people thought it was so great. Context makes a big difference. When you don't share the same context, you might not understand everything that is being presented. It's a little like learning another language, or not being functionally illiterate in one that you're expected to know. How we learn to navigate meaning and expression is an ongoing practice, throughout our lives.

This is a really great example of how translation is such a challenging thing to accomplish. Even translating between languages that share a common origin can result in misinterpretations. I can imagine that when you are working between two completely different linguistic systems that it becomes even more difficult to convey the original meaning.
