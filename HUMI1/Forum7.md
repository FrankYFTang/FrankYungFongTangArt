Observing is an important creative tool. Careful observation is the key to understanding the context of the issue we should address. For example, in the weekly Bible study I lead, we always study Biblical narratives by using the Inductive Bible study method (Bauer and Traina). The Inductive Bible study method requires us to approach the text in a three step process- Observation, Interpretation, and Application. Therefore, observation is the foundation for a fruitful study.

Our goal is to carefully observe, in order to correctly interpret, and then we can apply to our life appropriately. If the observation is not careful, then the interpretation will be misleading, and resulting in inappropriate application. For the genre of narrative text, the basic process is to observe the text and answer six W questions first- Who, When, Where, What, Why, and How. There are two different types of Why questions in the study- the observation type of why and the interpretation type of why. The observation type of why is the reason the author explicitly writes in the work to inform the reader, and often can be identified by paying attention to certain words, such as “since”, “because”, “therefore”, etc. Before we try to understand the text to answer the interpretation type of why, we should always find out what the author intends to tell us.

Another approach to observation is to compare and contrast two narratives next to each other. For example, when we study the text of the Gospel of Luke chapter 1, the miraculous birth announcements of two key figures: John the Baptist and Jesus, we can compare and contrast the two birth announcements to identify what are the common and contrast parts in those two stories. Such compare and contrast exercises help us to understand the significance of each story.  

Observation is very important in data science. Data Scientists observe the collected data to find out the correlation. Observation is also very important for artists. Artists need to carefully observe to render the subject. Writers could write better poems, stories, and prose when they observe their surrounding world carefully.

Dear Keven:

Your essay about Analogizing is very well written. Your example about how Steve Jobs compared technology to art is wonderful. I worked for Apple Computer in the days after he was kicked out and before he got back. In fall 1995, before I resigned from Apple, I predicted the only person who could save Apple was Steve Jobs and that happened two years later. I really admire Steve Jobs but unfortunately missed the opportunity to work under him.

Dear Sofiya:

The concept of mixing what already exists in a fresh way as Synthesizing is really a great creative tool. It is wonderful you use an architect as an example. It is wonderful you apply it in your art and design. I often apply that in my cooking. For example, this week while I cooked Greek Curry for my Thursday Chinese Bible study, I used fried gluten balls instead of chicken meat. I think sometimes the synthesizing was motivated by the need for replacement material.

Dear Carlos:

I think your example of 3-D printing as an example for Dimensional thinking is a good one. First of all, most 3-D printers these days are not only a projection from a 3-D world into a 2-D world, but the print heads are actually operated as a transformation from 2-D world into a time shift linear dimension since there is only one print head outputting the material. Therefore a 3-D printer really first slices the 3-D model into multiple 2-D layers, then prints each spot on that two dimension space at a time with the moving of the printer head.

Dear Arsalan

Thanks for sharing your view about modeling. Your mention of data collection about modeling is great. I believe that is the first step in modeling because if the data we collect is not enough or biased,  we won’t be able to build a representative model. Therefore, a good data collection is really the foundation of building an accurate model from my point of view. In recent years, one key area of using modeling is the economic model. Without a good economy, we will live in a scary world.


## Feedback
Thanks for sharing your example!

These creative sparks provide a starting point to talk about the way that we look at and process information and inspiration. Most of the time we are not consciously considering what sort of creative thinking tool we're going to apply, instead we simply do it. When we do take the time to consider how we go about finding solutions for whatever challenge or problem we face, identifying the method we rely on can reveal a connection to one of our strengths. This might also help you identify areas that you would like to improve. Relating that information to your field of study or personal emphasis - whether that is an academic, professional, or cultural focus - may also be revealing. Often we are unaware of how our interests and our study of certain subjects overlap. Finding those connections and bridging that information between fields is part of our goal.
