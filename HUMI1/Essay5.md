You’ve identified some interesting accomplishments about your subject!

Every individual gains unique life experience and those details are often overlooked in favor of the more familiar information we come to associate with their identity. It can be fun to discover how well-rounded a person is, especially when those specifics are less known facts. This is a research focus which is very open-ended because there is no limit to what people do and discover through the course of living. In addition to formal learning experiences, you might learn about a skill or accomplishment that is unknown and opens up a new area of exploration!

So interesting to think of how he worked with and was influenced by some of the early twentieth century notables. His career spanned such a long time that you forget he must have reinvented his style repeatedly.
