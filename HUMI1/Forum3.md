     Recognizing patterns often helps us to design generalized solutions. This intelligence helped me a lot in my previous project. In 2006, I was asked by a project manager in Google to design a better generalized solution to handle the entry and format of postal address for all Google products. Before my involvement, the AdSense engineering team first built an address form to allow all users in the US to enter their address, which include their name, company names, two lines of street address, city, 5 or 9 digits ZIP code, and state. But the problem comes when they try to expand their service area to Canada because there are no states but only provinces or territories. And they do not use 5 or 9 digits ZIP code but a mixed alphabetic and numeric characters as postal code. So the engineering team has to add a new form just for the Canadian users. Then they add one new address form for each country they expand to, until they hit six countries and realize this is not a good way to solve the problem so they call me to help. I spend a month studying every address in the world by looking at the postal address specification from all 240 countries/regions in the world from Universal Postal Union and designing a system to encode the order and format of the address into a condensed representation. The validation of ZIP or postal code are then expressed by using Regular Expression. And by recognizing the commonality and differences between all postal address forms in all the countries, I solve the problem by one single address format, with about 250 sets of configuration data, one for each country/region to change the order and validation rule for the address. The design is later coded into Java and JavaScript language and used in all Google products since 2008. Google open source this work as libaddressinput to the public in 2014 (Google). 

     This creativity is tightly connected to the invention domain. It helps me to innovate a highly reusable and expandable approach by using a general framework with different configuration data for the different settings. This approach reduces the complexity in software quality assurance and reduces the risk of software error while adding the support for a new market.

My designed and the code I wrote was later package by google and open source on https://github.com/google/libaddressinputLinks to an external site.

Dear Sofiya:

Your example about coastal ocean water temperature for recognizing patterns is wonderful. The limitation of scientific research is dealing with reproducible outcomes but not one time historical event. Therefore, when scientists observe repeatable outcomes across a certain size of sample, they could generalize and identify patterns from enough samples. This would be impossible to verify if such an event only happened once or twice, but verifiable if it could be observed repeatedly. I believe there is a prerequisite for pattern recognition- you need to have enough samples to recognize the pattern. If the one with such ability does not have a way to collect enough samples for a certain event, then that person will still not be able to conclude and pattern from them (Jain et al.) Therefore, in order to develop the pattern recognition ability, the study of statistics and probability theory is crucial (Webb). These theories help us to figure out how much sample we need to collect in order to recognize meaningful and unbiased patterns.

Dear Alondra 

I believe the word TRANSFORMING in English carries several different kinds of meaning. Our teacher, on the top of this assignment, defines the word TRANSFORMING as “The process of transforming ideas from one language of communication into another, using different sets of tools (mnemonic devices, scripts turned into plays).” In other words, I think she is talking about the ability to transform some concept or idea from one representation to another representation. I personally do not think your example of exercise fits that definition. I believe what you describe as transformation is a different concept using the same word.  If we look at Cambridge dictionary, they define the meaning of the word as “to completely change the appearance or character of something or someone, especially so that that thing or person is improved”. I believe your example fit that definition nicely. However, I think that is a different sense of the same word. I do not believe that definition is one of the  “thirteen common thinking tools of creative people” because I don’t think while exercise and transforming body shape is important, they are related to the concept of thinking or creativity, but rather tight to persistence and goal setting.

Dear Carlos 

Thank you for bringing up the discussion of observing. I would like to offer another example by using one of the big news this week- the 2025 Nobel prize of Physics. According to the announcement document released by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences: “This year’s Nobel Prize in Physics recognises experiments that demonstrated how quantum tunnelling can be observed on a macroscopic scale, involving many particles” (The Nobel Prize in Physics 2025). In other words, these three scientists changed how the scientific community observed quantum physics from a micro scale enlarger to a macroscopic scale, and therefore made the experiments much easier to conduct. “Michel, John Martinis and John Clarke proved … laws of quantum mechanics … could be revealed and controlled in a macroscopic electrical circuit on a chip.They created a superconducting electrical circuit …, that can be used to create and manipulate these quantum phenomena” (Neven). This example also show us the importance on the improving the ability of observation.

## Feedback
Thanks for sharing your example!

This week we explored different domains of creativity and learned there's not a lot of agreement about how many domains exist or what subjects or topics they encompass. This is further complicated by the fact that individuals are embedded in social systems and the cultural framework that you mature within influences much of your worldview. The more aware you become of your set of references, the easier it is to recognize when something pushes against your comfort zone. Since we never stop learning, we are always adding to, detracting from, and altering our perceptions. Ultimately, we don't have to even agree on a set number of creative domains, but it is essential to recognize what one person recognizes as a boundary another might not. Creativity bridges academic domains, and individuals can learn to bridge their specific definitions of creativity to experience those held by others.

I read your post with interest. I don't know anything about programming and designing complex interfaces like what you describe, but I can imagine how much data you had to source in order to come up with a workable idea to address the challenge of postal codes on a global scale. Amazing! It's fun that you included the link too. This is such a great example of how creativity and Innovation go hand-in-hand.
