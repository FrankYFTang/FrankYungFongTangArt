### IM Pei Multiple Intelligences

In the prolonged 102 years of IM Pei’s life, he strongly demonstrates the strength of Visual-Spatial Intelligence, Mathematical-Logical Intelligence, and Interpersonal Intelligence in his architectural career. Screenshot 2025-11-14 at 8.57.08 PM.png

Pei surely tops his talents in Visual-Spatial Intelligence. As an architect, Pei frequently communicates his ideas and three dimensional concepts in images and pictures through structure illustrations. He is highly conscious of objects, shapes, textures, and patterns in the environment around. In his most famous work Louvre Pyramid, he utilized the ancient form of the Egyptian Pyramid, with the transparent material of glass, to blend the ancient form into western European form. We observe many architectural sketches drawn by Pei. Pei is also very aware of the environment. For example, before he agreed to take the Bank of China Tower in Hong Kong, he mandated “a land swap with an adjacent government property” to “reshape the Bank of China’s lot into a parallelogram” (Rubalcaba et al. 59). Another example is when he designed the East Building of National Gallery of Art in Washington DC, he “sliced a trapezoid into two triangles, the lines of the old gallery matching up perfectly with the lines of the new” (Rubalcaba et al. 38). Pei was excellent at performing visualizing, imaging, and forming mental images during the design stage of his architectures. All his works, such as his design of National Center for Atmospheric Research, John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, National Gallery of Art, East Building, Fragrant Hill Hotel, Bank of China, Louvre, and Miho Museum serves as evidence of his excellency in Visual-Spatial Intelligence.

While solving problems, Pei often depends on his Mathematical-Logical Intelligence. He approaches the design abstractly and conceptually and is able to see patterns and relationships that are missed by others. This talent is evidenced in his early academy choice, mentioned in several sources: “His strengths were math and science, not drawing. Pei transferred to MIT to study engineering” (Rubalcaba et al. 8) and “Pei’s strength lay in mathematics, and he never wanted to be an artist” (Huang 13). He employed “visual effects with abstract geometric forms and mathematical order to give people a visual impact” while he needed to streamline unwieldy and superfluous architectural adornments in traditional design. Such an aesthetic concept of design was later analyzed by Luo through three aspects: functionalism of "less is more", humanism of "locality", and naturalism of "taking advantage of the situation" (Luo 1851).

Finally, Pei showed strong Interpersonal Intelligence in his career. While preparing to welcome the visit of Jacqueline Kennedy, he “repainted the walls. Tossed or hid all clutter. And dusted off and displayed some of his finest project models” (Rubalcaba et al.  30). Pei was concerned about his work on a personal level and said, “I had to think about the president, what would he like it to be. I think that’s number one.” This shows a strong sign of how he depends on his Interpersonal Intelligence in his design work and his interest to deeply understand his client’s points of view.

From the above evidence, we see Pei’s success is mainly based on his Image Smart, Math Smart, and People Smart. Visual-Spatial, Mathematical-Logical, and Interpersonal Intelligence greatly influenced his work and made him one of the most influential architects of the 20th and 21st century.

## Feedback
You’ve identified three possible multiple intelligences about your subject!

Identifying your own multiple intelligences can be difficult because we don't easily see our accomplishments and skills through objective eyes. When researching a stranger, we more readily reach conclusions about their success based on what we see as instrumental influences and responses. Outside perceptions may not be entirely accurate, but in general, stronger correlations between the strengths are evident within an individual’s successes and their contributions to a particular industry or domain.
