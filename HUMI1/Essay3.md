* Ieoh Ming Pei was born in China in 1917 and was educated in the United States under modernist architects Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer (13).
* His national identity is closely associated with American post-war modernism and its search for a national expression (23).
* While a modernist, Pei’s "international style" was not rigid; it evolved to incorporate regional characteristics and historical context (24).
* His design for the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha is praised for flawlessly integrating traditional Islamic motifs with a modernist aesthetic (45). 
* The thesis suggests Pei's architecture aims to transcend shifting stylistic labels and "isms" by focusing on durable principles of geometry, function, and context (45).
* The French press and public conservatives fueled the controversy, framing the project as an inappropriate intrusion by a foreigner (70).
* The design is considered neo-modernist, using a modern architectural language to engage with Berlin's fractured 20th-century history (104).
* Pei designed the modern extension for Berlin's German Historical Museum (DHM), which is officially known as the "PeiBau" (106).
* The new extension is linked to the historic Zeughaus via an underground pathway, preserving the integrity of both structures (106).
* The extension's asymmetrical, glass-and-stone form stands in stark, intentional contrast to the historic, classical main building, the Zeughaus (107).
* A signature element is the spiraling glass tower, which serves as a beacon and provides visual connections to the surrounding historic cityscape (108).
* The building features a glass curtain wall, French limestone (Magny le Louvre), and interior concrete cast from Oregon pine wood forms (110).
* The extension's triangular forms echo the diamond shapes used in his East Wing of the National Gallery, demonstrating a consistent element in his work (110).
* The glass tower intentionally frames views of the Zeughaus and the nearby Neue Wache monument, creating an "architectural correspondence" between past and present (112).
* Pei's use of precise geometry and transparency is seen as an acknowledgment of the work of Karl Friedrich Schinkel, a 19th-century Prussian architect who is considered a forerunner of modernism (119).
* His major European projects (the Louvre and DHM) were backed by powerful governmental patrons (President Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl), highlighting the link between architecture and state power (133; 160).
* Pei was commissioned in 1982 for the "Grand Louvre" project, a massive undertaking to modernize and reorganize the historic Paris museum (149).
* The project ignited a massive public and political controversy known as "la Bataille de la pyramide" (The Battle of the Pyramid) (155).
* The multiple, often conflicting, interpretations of the Louvre can be understood through Wittgenstein's "language-game" theory, where architecture's meaning is formed by a complex web of uses and descriptions (157).
* Critic Annette Fierro interpreted the pyramid’s transparency as a "paradoxical subnarrative" of President Mitterrand’s desire to create a modern, "transparent" national identity (160).
* The Grand Louvre project is analyzed as a complex "text" whose meaning is shaped by critics, the public, and the architect himself (162).
* The project's centerpiece and most famous feature is the 21.6 meter (71 foot) high Glass Pyramid, which now serves as the museum's main entrance (164).
* The project was designed to better integrate the Louvre into the city's fabric, notably by reinforcing the historic east-west axis of Paris (164).
* The debates around Pei's work reveal paradoxes, such as the Louvre pyramid being intended as an "invisible monument" that is actually highly visible (165).
* Pei defended the modern design by stating its glass-and-steel structure was meant to signify a break with past traditions and be "a work of our time" (168).
* Influential critic Charles Jencks rejected the idea of neutrality, arguing the pyramid was loaded with symbolism and that its form was an act of "megalomania" (174).
* Jencks also criticized the pyramid's "high-tech" glass for being opaque rather than transparent, blocking the view of the historic palace and embodying modernist "whiteness" (177).
* Commissioned in 1998 by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the project was part of an effort to enhance Berlin's image after German reunification (133).
* The intense public reactions to his work show that architecture's meaning is often determined by social and political factors far beyond its form or function (181).
* Pei's modern forms, like the pyramid, are seen as "historical quotations" that deliberately detach from their original meanings to create something new (201).
* He became a world-renowned museum architect, with the East Wing of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., cementing his reputation in the field (180).
* Beyond museums, he designed other famous public projects such as the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston (180).
* Pei's identity as a Chinese-American was often a central point of discussion and controversy, influencing how his work was perceived internationally (189).
* A primary function of the pyramid was to create a spacious, light-filled underground lobby, the Hall Napoleon, to improve visitor circulation (180).
* Much of the criticism was not architectural but xenophobic, focusing intensely on Pei’s "foreign" identity as a Chinese-American architect (182).
* During a key presentation to a historical commission, Pei was verbally attacked with racial slurs (184).
* A 1985 poll found that 53% of Parisians were against the pyramid, demonstrating the depth of the initial opposition (187).
* Pei's work, particularly at the Louvre, is seen as a reaction against the postmodern trend of appropriating past styles, instead proposing a modern yet historically sensitive solution (198).
* To counter the emotional debate, Pei and his team presented the project in terms of "neutral" geometric logic and functional necessity (193).
* Critic Robert Mugerauer offered another view, seeing the pyramid as a "deconstructive synthesis" that displaces the ancient Egyptian meaning of pyramids to create a new, contemporary symbol of power (198).
* A core tenet of his design philosophy was achieving a balance of "time, place, and purpose" (246).
* Projects like the Fragrant Hill Hotel and Suzhou Museum in China sparked academic debate over whether they represented American modernism or an expression of his Chinese roots (267).
* His major government-sponsored projects were often politically significant and had a transformative effect on the urban landscapes of capital cities (270).
* His architecture is famously characterized by the use of clean geometric forms and large glass structures (272).
* Mugerauer noted that unlike solid Egyptian pyramids symbolizing death, Pei's glass structure reflects its living environment (201). 
* Pei's work demonstrates how museums can function as powerful tools for shaping a city's historical tradition and modern image (263).
* The analysis of Pei's architectural drawings suggests they are a form of communication that reveals a building's meaning beyond historical context or style (212).
