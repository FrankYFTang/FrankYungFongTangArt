Analogizing is a very good way to create an innovative explanation to connect ancient ideas to modern human society. My wife and I gathered 15-25 De Anza mandarin speaking students to our home every Thursday night to study Bible together. We often need to explain some information on the Biblical text to some students who have never read the Bible before. Analogizing provides a very powerful way to connect college students today to the textual description written down two thousand years ago. Below are two examples I used in our Bible study last year.

While we study the text of Gospel of John Chapter 21, the narrative states Jesus came to the shore of the Galilee sea calling his disciples fishing on the boat, “they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits away” (John 21:8/NASB). To explain how far the distance is, I read some commentary and found out that it is equivalent to 90 meters away. But telling the students 90 meters is too boring. So I created an image to show the distance between the Turtle statue in De Anza L quad and the fountain in Main quad is about the length of 90 meters and told the students to stand in front of the Turtle statue to look toward the Main quad fountain.

In The Book of Ruth Chapter 3, the main character Boaz “measured six measures of barley and laid it on “ Ruth (Ruth 3:15/NASB). I found that the amount is about the weight of 50 pounds. So I purchased a bag of 50 Lbs dogfood from Costco and asked some female students to carry that bag on their shoulder to walk a short distance during our study. This analogizing helped my fellow classmates to truly understand how much barley Ruth carried back that day.

These two examples illustrate how we can analogize the ancient length and volume quantity mentioned in the Holy Bible to modern day college students. It helps us to understand the true meaning hard to express by just words and challenges the participants to understand the Bible not only by their brain but also by their muscles. 

I created these two object lessons while I prepare our weekly Bible study. I believe it was sparked during the evolution creative stages because it fit into the overall design of the Bible study. I first put down all what I need to conduct during the Bible study and realize I need to help the students to understand these two particular ancient units. So I research what are some common experiences we all have in our daily life. It is part of the evolution process because it came after I realized informing the participants the cold converted result would be too boring to learn. So it evolved from 90 meters to the distance between the two point of interest inside De Anza college and evolved from 50 lbs to a large bag of dog food.

Dear Carlos

I agree with you that Recognizing Patterns is an important creative tool. The issue is what are the basic requirements to Recognizing Patterns. To generalize meaningful patterns, we do need to have enough sample size of samples. If we only have a handful of sample data, we may overfit the pattern in the learning process instead of learning general knowledge. We also need to avoid biased samples or clustered samples. A common approach for Recognizing Patterns is linear regression, which finds the correlation relationship between the observed input to a meaningful output. Another approach is decision tree, which classified output into different categories based on the observed input with a tree of decision.

Dear Keven:

I think Abstracting can usually be achieved in two ways- generalization and specialization. Generalization finds the commonality from the observed samples and specialization factors out the differential factors from the observed samples. In software development, abstracting could also be formed by parameterization. A function with parameters is a mathematical form of abstraction and commonly used in software development. A Locale identifier, as defined by Unicode consumption, is a textual identifier of abstraction to identify a culture preference.

Dear Raquel:

I believe the key value of playing as a creative process is the reduction of risk. Human beings are often constrained from creativity due to their fear of risk. While we fear about the cost we need to pay for failure, humans tend to take conservative approaches that just repeat the status quo, even when we have no idea why the status quo is there at first. Playing moves our thinking process to a safe place where the cost of failure is tiny and the risk of failure is minimized. Playing empowers us to explore new ways to react and therefore create new ways of living.
## Feedback
Thanks for sharing your example! I love the creative solution to distance by providing visual examples which the participants would recognize. 

No matter which creative spark is used to provide an example, there is a larger application of creative process in identifying the connection between the spark and how each student example illustrates that linkage. Because we are doing this assignment every week using a different type of creative spark, it is amazing how different the examples are when we consider them in the context of the topic.
