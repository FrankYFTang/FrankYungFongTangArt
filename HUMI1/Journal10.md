Thanks for sharing your response! 

 

This kind of intelligence always makes me think of people who enjoy big conversation with deep topics, the kind of discussions which take place over vats of coffee and in unexpected places. People who demonstrate a strong element of this intelligence tend to find creative solutions and explore unique options for big issues. If this doesn’t feel like a personal strength, it doesn’t mean you don’t have this sort of intelligence, maybe it’s only that you haven’t found the subject or circumstance which brings it to the forefront!


That is some beautiful record keeping. What a great experience that you provide for so many homeschool students. I homeschooled my son and it was one of the best experiences of my life - and his, I think.
