This kind of intelligence demonstrates awareness of the natural world. If you find yourself venturing out into the wilderness or visiting parks to escape the stresses of the modern world, this might be one of your strengths. Alternatively, if you like to collect rocks, shells, leaves, or other natural ephemera - or arrange them into patterns and classifications - this is probably a multiple intelligence which resonates for you. If this doesn’t feel like a personal strength, then perhaps you’ve never given it enough time to develop? Explore the world around you with a focus on what you can see and experience right outside your door.

One of the most fun exercises I ever did as a student was documenting an entire lunar cycle for an astronomy class. The entire process made me so much more aware of how objects shift across the night sky. Even though I was already aware that happened, tracking the changes made it feel more pronounced.
