## Submission
By examining IM Pei’s works, I believe the following are his most successful projects and what motivate him to achieve these design:

The Louvre Pyramid in Paris, France: “Pei’s Chinese heritage gave him a profound appreciation of the importance of the past, and his American experience had taught him how best to utilize modern public space” (Rubalcaba 70).
East Building, National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C: “Pei’s first design concern was to make the East Building compelling for young people” and “museum visitors get tired after about 45 minutes… translated into about 10,000 square feet of viewing” (Rubalcaba 38).
Bank of China Tower in Hong Kong: family connection - his father, Tsuyee Pei, was chief manager at the Shanghai headquarters of the Bank of China (Xiao 91).
John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston, Massachusetts: “Pei said, “I had to think about the president, what would he like it to be. I think that’s number one” (Rubalcaba 31)
Museum of Islamic Art in Doha, Qatar: “ bridging the gap between tradition and modernity” (Rubalcaba 91).
