The process of modeling is vastly used in Economics. In the discussion of economic theory, such as the formula of GDP, economists simplified complex real world development dynamics into a five variable formula- GDP = C + I + G + (X-M), where C, Consumption, is defined as all spending on goods and services by households, I, Investment, is defined as all spending on capital equipment, inventories, and housing by businesses, G, Government Spending, is defined as all government expenditures on goods and services, including salaries and public projects, and (X-M) , Net Exports, is defined as the value of a country's exports minus its imports (Masood). This approach helps the economy to measure the money dynamic on a macroeconomic scale (Leščinskij). 

Modeling, therefore, greatly impacts how the politics of power in the creativity of policy making. By using the formula of GDP, politicians and administration officers consider the problem in a grant scale, rather than in details of activities. The numbers in the GDP formula, therefore help the policy maker to compare, evaluate, and craft policy proposals and gain support from the people. Without such modeling, politicians won’t be able to easily compare the pros and cons of two different policy designs. For example, the policy maker could increase the GDP by encouraging more private investment, or decrease more imports. The reality is often every policy impacts more than one variable in the formula. However, the formula does help us discuss the complex issue easier.

Dear Arsalan:

Body Thinking is an interesting way to push our mind into a new realm. The Bible states:  “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one!  You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. (Deuteronomy 6:4-5, New King James Version) Notice in the Bible, God asks His followers not to love him with just their thought, but all their “strength”, implying a primitive form of Body Thinking. A lot of teaching in the Bible cannot be fully comprehended without involving executing His command in action. This shows the concept of Body Thinking existed in the world more than 3,200 years ago as documented in the Bible.

Dear Keity

Thank you for using the architectural work of Zaha Hadid to illustrate the power of Dimensional Thinking. Her work is wonderful. This reminds me of the building of the Guggenheim museum in NYC. In the Guggenheim museum, most of the shapes are curved or rounded and not rectangular. Even their elevator and restroom are in a half circle.

Dear Keven:

Thank you for sharing about Body Thinking. I think we often isolate our knowledge away from our body and contain them only in our brain. Body Thinking helps us to engage other parts of our senses and push our intelligence into different parts of our body to engage the world.

Thanks for sharing your example!

One of the ways creativity most informs our lives is art. If you consider only the art we choose to display in our living spaces, an observer can conclude certain things about our preferences, likes and dislikes, and sometimes far more expansive information. The politics and power in creativity are complex because not only does the artist have a perspective which is often conveyed through their work, the viewer also brings with them all kinds of context. Every generation influences visual media, and is in turn influenced by their exposure to the same information. All of you are very good at navigating this because it is a part of your life - but we are not always that successful at recognizing all the perspectives which are potentially evident in a composition or installation. Exploring those ideas through art can be revealing.
