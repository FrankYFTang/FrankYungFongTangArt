A poem I wrote in May this year while I toured Turkey

Bruised Leg in Central Turkey

Bruised leg!

Hurt!

Are those blood clots?

I wonder

 

After a long flight from home

Wondering in central Turkey 

Feeling alone

The left leg is swollen and painful 

But I am not afraid 

 

I lived a good life 

If God wants to take me home today 

Let me rest in Your peace

I know You will take care my wife and children 

But my leg still hurt

 

Aspirin!

Thanks for sharing your response! 

 

For people who like words, demonstrating verbal or linguistic intelligence is not overtly challenging. Because this is a skill set that comes more naturally it isn't that difficult to sit down and produce a creative writing piece. Students become skilled at many types of writing during their academic careers but learning how to transition those abilities outside the campus community can require practice. 

 

For individuals who do not find writing a natural strength, pushing out those words can feel very labor intensive, if not overwhelming. It's helpful to recognize the activities which come more easily to you because it allows you to estimate the amount of time you will need to set aside for a task.

 

This is delightful. I like the contrast of strength and vulnerability, and that touch of humor.
