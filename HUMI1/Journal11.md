My Top Three Intelligences

Under the theory of Multiple Intelligences by Gardner, I believe my top three intelligences are Logical-Mathematical Intelligence, Visual-Spatial Intelligence, and Musical Intelligence (Davis) while these three didn’t capture my best talent in cooking. 

I demonstrated strong Logical-Mathematical Intelligence ever since I was very young. During my elementary school, I always loved the subject of mathematics and didn't feel tired of solving math problems. After I finished my middle school in ninth grade, I decided to enter a five year Junior Engineering College in Taiwan to study Electronic Engineering. In that program we study advanced very early on. For example, to solve circus design problems, we started to learn Laplace's equation when we were in tenth grade. We also learn Fourier transforms to solve communication issues the same year. I self learned BASIC, Fortran, Forth, Pascal programming languages before I was 20 years old. I learned Z80, 6502, 8086, and 68000 CPU architecture and machine languages at the same time. During my military service at the Republic of China  Army Headquarter, I learned COBOL, SQL and C language. After I moved to the USA, I worked for Apple Computer, Netscape Communication, AOL and now Google for over 32 years. During my career, I applied and got seven software patents granted (Edberg et al.; Daniels et al.; Tang et al.; Tang 2004; Tang 2006; Tian). All these achievements are evidence of my strong achievement in Logical-Mathematical Intelligence. 

I also enjoy my Visual-Spatial Intelligence from many aspects. Since I was a kid, my mom sent me to take art classes till my third grade, when the teacher terminated her program. Because of my interest in image, I took Computer Graphics, Computer Vision, Image Processing in my Computer Science master study at Northeastern University, Boston. Combined with my  Logical-Mathematical Intelligence, I flourished in my class and two of my professors recommended me to teach their undergraduate Computer Graphics course in Winter quarter 1993, even before I received my master degree. In 2018, I started to paint Acrylic and Watercolor portraits for my stepfather and other loved ones. Last year, I entered three of my artwork to the De Anza College Student Art show 2024 in Euphrat Museum of Art and my Self-Portrait in Pastel won the Drawing Award (Previous Highlights). My Self-Portrait in Watercolor was selected and published in the 2024 Red Wheelbarrow Student Edition (Edited by Morgan Fernandez et al.). This year, I also received one of the three Annette Pearlstein Scholarship Awards from Foothill College for my dedication and achievement in paintings (“Awards & Recognition”). Three of my artworks were displayed in the De Anza College Student Art show 2025 in May 2025 and my Acrylic self portrait Binary Black Holes were featured in the La Voz News in 5 June 2025 (Boobekova) and 2024 Red Wheelbarrow Student Edition (Edited by Makayla Aguilar-Zuniga et al.). Foothill College library also exhibited 23 of my artworks in June 2025 (Tang 2025). All these were powerful pieces of evidence showing my achievements in Visual-Spatial Intelligence. 

Due to my family finance difficulty and growing up in a single parent family, I didn’t learn any musical instruments during my childhood. Thank God that I had the opportunity to join the Church choir when I was 16 years old and gave me the opportunity to use my vocal cord as the best musical instrument to praise my sweet Lord Jesus. I was first singing Tenor during my teens but later switched to Bass. I spent many years in a Church choir and had the chance to meet my wife Christine who is the best female singer I befriended. We share a long duration of cherished moments in church choir and enjoy singing both classical hymns as well as Broadway musical and contemporary Mandarin pop music together in KTV. Several years ago, I took a De Anza Choir course with my wife and my daughter together and auditioned for a Solo part. I sing very well and have a beautiful voice. Even though I didn’t get selected for the role I still believe Musical Intelligence is one of my best strengths since I really enjoy it.

While I believe my best intelligences under Gardner's theory of Multiple Intelligences are Logical-Mathematical Intelligence, Visual-Spatial Intelligence, and Musical Intelligence, I believe my best strengths are not counted in his framework. My best talent is in my cooking. I am a great chef and always cook wonderful food for many of my friends in our Thursday night Bible Study hosted at my home. Gardner somehow didn’t count the sense of smell and taste into his theory of Multiple Intelligences and therefore discount all the achievements by people who have special talent relying on smell and taste. Unfortunately, I believe this is a vital shortcoming in his theory. I wish Gardner can refine and expand his theory to cover those intelligences depending on a person’s taste and smell. 

In the first week of the survey quiz, my results show the top three as Logic/math 4.71, Self 3.71 and Musical 3.43, which match the top and the third one I selected but missed the Visual-Spatial. As for my career I have been a Computer Programmer for more than 38 years already and that matches well. I am considering extending to professional painters after my retirement from software development and that also matches my Visual-Spatial Intelligence . 

I believe the most important impact to my software engineering study is actually from my Visual-Spatial Intelligence. I often convert the relationship within a complex software system into class diagrams or object diagrams. Also I have great interest in data visualization when I study Data Science. I believe these help both me and my customers to learn about their knowledge much easier and take a unique approach than others. My Visual-Spatial Intelligences also help me to discuss or brainstorming with my colleague by using visual diagrams rather than textual description or purely mathematical formulas. I also often produce better presentation slide in our engineering tasks.

Thanks for sharing your response! 

 

Identifying your top skill-sets and preferences for learning can be helpful in navigating your education. Not only is it fun to see how these concepts might influence decision-making or provide initial interest in careers and opportunities, but it's also important to recognize there are no single factors which provide access to success. Taking an objective look at the things you enjoy and the things which you do not, can help clarify the reasons we tend to do well in certain areas and struggle in others. Knowing that may provide the scaffolding to improve or avoid pitfalls. I hope you've enjoyed learning about this part of the course materials!

 

This is wonderful - I enjoyed seeing how these intelligences are revealed in your achievements.
