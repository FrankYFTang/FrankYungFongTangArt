# ARTS 2C History of Art: Europe from the Baroque Period Through Impressionism

I took ARTS 2C History of Art: Europe from the Baroque Period Through Impressionism in De Anza College during Spring 2023 (April 10 - June 01, 2023). This repo archived my work for this course. My professor is Deborah Pasturel.
* [Week 2 Writing](ARTS2CWeek2Writing.pdf)
  * **Prompt:** Utilizing Artemisia Gentileschi's painting of Judith Slaying Holofernes, compare it to Caravaggio's Judith Beheading Holofernes (see the last slide in Lecture 5). How are they both prime examples of the Italian Baroque style? How do they differ? One painting is by a female artist, the other by a man. Is it obvious which is which? Why, or why not? 
* Midterm TBD
* **Research Paper**:
  * Feedback from Professor: "Your paper is extraordinary. Your level of analysis and research are beyond impressive. You might want to consider a graduate degree in Art history!"
* Final TBD
