# ARTS 2C History of Art: Europe from the Baroque Period Through Impressionism

I took ARTS 2C History of Art: Europe from the Baroque Period Through Impressionism in De Anza College during Spring 2023 (April 10 - June 01, 2023). This repo archived my work for this course. My professor was Deborah Pasturel.
* [Week 2 Writing](ARTS2CWeek2Writing.pdf)
  * **Prompt:** Utilizing Artemisia Gentileschi's painting of Judith Slaying Holofernes, compare it to Caravaggio's Judith Beheading Holofernes (see the last slide in Lecture 5). How are they both prime examples of the Italian Baroque style? How do they differ? One painting is by a female artist, the other by a man. Is it obvious which is which? Why, or why not? 
* [Midterm](Arts%202C%20Midterm.pdf)
  * **Prompt:** In what ways does the Baroque period in the Netherlands differ from the Baroque in the other countries we discussed? Examine the period both artistically and religiously. b.How was the Baroque period impacted by the Counter-Reformation? c. Discuss how the Protestant Reformation and the Catholic Counter-Reformation led to different religious practices and inspired different styles of art. Select at least one artist from each country we have studied, and analyze how each made use of varying Baroque characteristics in his/her art.
  * **Extra Credit:** How were the Baroque and Rococo styles similar and different? Where did each style begin, to whom did they most appeal, and why? (5 points possible)
* **Research Paper:** [The Thinker / Le Penseur (1881) by Auguste Rodin](ARTS2CPaper.pdf)
  * **Feedback from Professor:** "Your paper is extraordinary. Your level of analysis and research are beyond impressive. You might want to consider a graduate degree in Art history!"
* Final TBD
