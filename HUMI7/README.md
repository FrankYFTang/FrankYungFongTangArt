# HUMI 7 The Arts and the Human Spirit

## Discussion 1 Introduction

Hi everyone:


My name is Yungfong Tang. You can also simply call me Frank.  I plan to double major in AA/Art History and AA/Painting. I may apply to transfer to San Jose State University later. You can view some of my art works and research papers I wrote for other History of Art courses at https://github.com/FrankYFTang/FrankYungFongTangArt . I am a member of the De Anza Fellowship of Overseas Students (FOS) club and would love to share God’s love and blessing through my paintings to people around me.  I would like to improve my skill to render portraits. I found painting portraits for the one I care is a good way to share my love to them. I rendered two portraits to my stepfather one month before he passed away at 94 years old and I know he was very happy about that. I also painted portraits as a retirement gift to two of my colleagues. The most relaxing part is of course rendering self portraits since nobody in this world could tell me they do not like them.  I love the artworks of Chuck Close, Georgia O’Keeffe, Lee Krasner, Edgar Degas, Liu Hung, Hope Gangloff, Auguste Rodin, Gustav Klimt, Henri Matisse, and Claude Monet.

I submitted three artworks to the De Anza Student Art Show 2024 and one of my Chalk Pastel won the Drawing award. See https://www.deanza.edu/euphrat/previous.htmlLinks to an external site.

One other artwork I submitted is titled "Annunciation", 2023, collage. This is one of my project in Arts 4B class last yer. I also submitted the following description: The angel Gabriel in this work is depicted as a figure with a claw hammer as body, lobster claws and legs, and bird wings. Gabriel is a given name derived from the Hebrew name Gaḇrīʾēl (גַבְרִיאֵל) meaning "God is my strength", or "God is a strong man" (“Liturgy Alive”). Therefore, a claw hammer as a body fit the name very well since the hammer is strong and has strength. The figure has eight lobster legs and two lobster claws, representing their multitasking ability and strength. Their wings symbolize they are above human society. Gabriel holds an orange handbag and a scepter on the right claw. The handbag “represents creativity, adventurousness, and optimism. In color psychology, orange is often associated with energy, balance, and warmth. It can evoke feelings of joy, sunshine, and tropical sunsets, making it the perfect summer color” (Ticuleanu). Sceptre is an “ornamented rod or staff borne by rulers on ceremonial occasions as an emblem of authority and sovereignty” therefore it represents that Gabriel is speaking while representing the sovereignty of God (“Sceptre”). Gabriel is hovering above the world, which is rendered with earthly treasure on top of grids of colorful cells drawn in one point linear perspective. This represents Gabriel on top of the earthly world. The background is black to contrast the gold/silver halo that beams out lights. Name of Gabriel, written in red uppercase Greek letters, could be seen on the top of the inner ring of their halo. The words “Greetings” “favored one” and “The Lord is with you” are in the background showing what Gabriel said to Mary at that moment, according to Luke 1:28 NASB.

My most recent work is "Binary Black Holes", 2024, Acrylic, 48x60. This is the first time I explore painting bigger canvas. Hope you like it. You can see the progress of making in https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZRXSS6SRtmy2DBVXALinks to an external site.  It took me total two months to paint it.
